            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <div type="case">
               <head>
                  <hi>John Ernly</hi> Esq; Plaintiff, <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> and <hi>Jo. Doddington</hi> Esq; Defendants.</head>
               <p>IN an <hi>Action upon the Case</hi> upon a Promise the Plaintiff <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(1)"/> declared, That whereas upon the <hi>17th</hi> day of <hi>February</hi> in the year <hi>1653.</hi> there was a Communication betwéen the Plaintiff and the Defendants concerning an <hi>Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> to be run the usual four Mile Course at <hi>Burford</hi> in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire;</hi> upon that Agréement it was concluded betwéen the Plaintiff and the Defendants to run it with a Bay Stone-horse against a Gray Stone-horse on Thursday five Weeks next after that day, and betwixt the hours of <hi>2</hi> and <hi>4</hi> in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. The one Rider to weigh <hi>16</hi> pound more than the other, who was to weigh <hi>10</hi> Stone; and he or they that lost, were to pay the other or others <hi>200 l.</hi> when required. And <hi>whereas</hi> likewise the Defendants in consideration the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff promised to perform his part of the said Agréement, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to perform their part thereof; and then alledges that although he performed his part of the said Agréement, and that the Race was run at the time, and that the Parties then weighed the weights agreed on, and that the Plaintiffs Horse won the Race, yet the Defendants refuse to pay the <hi>200 l.</hi> and avers a particular request, and lays it to his damage of <hi>300 l.</hi> Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Non assumpsit</hi> pleaded, a Verdict passed for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> and <hi>200 l.</hi> damages given him. And it was now moved in <hi>Arrest of Judgment</hi> by <hi>Hardres</hi> for the <hi>Defendants. 1.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Promise, which is the ground of the Action, is not sufficiently averred, but laid only by way of <hi>Recital; viz. Whereas the Defendants promised, &amp;c.</hi> which is not a direct
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52142:7"/> positive Averment, as there ought to be, In <hi>4 Rep. Sir Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Gerrard's Case,</hi> it is resolved, that the word <hi>sciens</hi> is not a direct Averment upon which a Traverse or Issue may be taken: So in <hi>5 Rep. Semain's Case, Praemissorum non ignarus</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be an insufficient Allegation of Notice, where No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is necessary; and that it ought to be directly and certainly alledged, <hi>7 H. 7. 2.</hi> In <hi>Trespass</hi> for cutting down and carrying away Trées, resolved that the words <hi>praetextu cujus</hi> is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and positive affirmation of <hi>Seisin</hi> to make good a Plea; and in <hi>3 H. 7. 11. &amp; 3 Ed. 4. 21.</hi> it is ruled that <hi>Declarations</hi> ought to be <hi>certain,</hi> because they contain the ground of the Plaintiff's Action. <hi>Mich. 43 &amp; 44 Eliz. Garforth and Clerk's Case,</hi> in an Action upon the Case for words, the Plaintiff de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that slanderous words were spoken <hi>Quorum tenor se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur in haec verba;</hi> and this was adjudged to be nought after a Verdict, for want of a certain Allegation, though the words were actionable in themselves. <hi>Hill. 22 Car. B. R. Entr. Trin. 22 Car. Rot. 173. Waterhouse versus Power,</hi> In an Action up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Case the Plaintiff alledged that the Defendant <hi>inter alia</hi> made such a Promise; and this was ruled to be nought, though after Verdict, for want of certainty. So here the word <hi>Whereas Quod cum</hi> is not a direct and positive Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but an imperfect speech, and therefore ill. <hi>Mich. 24 Car. B. R. Dawson <hi>versus</hi> Parkly, Trespass of Battery</hi> and entry into Lands laid with a <hi>Quod cum</hi> adjudged to be nought; and there it was said to have been often adjudged so. There is a diversity betwixt Matters that are but <hi>Conveyances</hi> and <hi>Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to Actions, and Matters that are the very <hi>grounds</hi> and <hi>foundations</hi> of Actions. <hi>Inducements</hi> need not be so precisely alledged; and therefore to say <hi>quod cum sit indebitatus, &amp;c.</hi> in an Action upon the Case, is well enought: So in <hi>34 H. 6. 4. in Decies tantum</hi> the Record in the former Action needs not be recited at large, because it is but a conveyance to the Action: But in a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon a Iudgment the whole Record must be set forth, <hi>19 H. 6. 49. acc.</hi> so here it is well in the Inducement but not in the Promise it self. <hi>Trin. 35 Eliz. B. C. Hughs <hi>versus</hi> Robotham</hi> in an Action upon the Case upon a Promise, the same difference was taken. <hi>See</hi> the Case now reported, <hi>Cr. Eliz. 302, 303.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Every <hi>Issue</hi> must contain a certain positive <hi>affirmative</hi> and <hi>negative:</hi> but in this Case there is no direct affirmative, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid with a <hi>quod cum,</hi> and consequently this is a <hi>Jeofail</hi> not aided: For though an <hi>immaterial</hi> Issue be aided, as in an Action of Debt upon a Bill, Issue taken upon <hi>payment,</hi> as in <hi>5 Rep. Nichols Case;</hi> yet an unformal Issue, in which there is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52142:7"/> not an affirmative and a negative, is not added; and so it has been often adjudged in the Common Pleas.</p>
               <p>Another Exception he took was to the last averment, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Parties <hi>then</hi> weighed, and the word <hi>then</hi> he said must relate to the <hi>proximum antecedens</hi> which is certain, and not to an uncertain time; as in <hi>28 H. 8. Dyer 14. b. Bowles Case,</hi> the word <hi>then</hi> related there to the <hi>Feast</hi> and not to the <hi>Parties death,</hi> tho the <hi>Parties death</hi> had been last mentioned. And if in this case it be taken to relate to the last certain time that has been mentioned before, then the performance does not appear to have been according to the agreement; for the time last mentioned is four of the Clock in the Afternoon, whereas they ought to weigh the Weights agreed upon at the time of Riding. Wherefore he prayed that Iudgment might be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atkins pro Quer'.</hi> As to the <hi>Objection</hi> concerning the <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the word <hi>then,</hi> He said it ought to be taken accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Common Exposition, and with respect to the Subject Matter, especially since here it is said that they weighed the Weights agreed upon: To the other <hi>Objection</hi> he said that the word <hi>whereas</hi> was certain enough, as the word <hi>licet</hi> in <hi>Det, Plow. Com. 121. Buckleys Case.</hi> And in <hi>Det</hi> it is the usual Form to begin with a <hi>quod cum:</hi> And so the Presidents are in this Court, which make a Law; <hi>V. Plow. Com. 128. New Book of Entr. fol. 2, 4, 12. and the Old Book of Entries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At another day the <hi>Chief Baron</hi> gave his Opinion, that no Objection of weight had been made, but only that concerning the <hi>quod cum;</hi> But he conceiv'd the Promise certainly enough alledged, and said, it was as direct an affirmation as the word <hi>licet</hi> in the Case afore-mentioned: But that that sway'd with him, he said, was <hi>Presidents,</hi> of which there are two in the <hi>New Book of Entries,</hi> and seven in the <hi>Old,</hi> where a <hi>quod cum</hi> is used in the very Clause of the Promise. And <hi>Saunders</hi> in <hi>Buckleys Case, Plow. Com.</hi> agreed, if Presidents were so; and yet the words in a <hi>Formedon in descender ut Filio &amp; hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redi</hi> are as material as the words here in question; wherefore Iudgment was given <hi>pro Quer', Pasch. 39 Eliz. Matthews and Cranes Case</hi> upon a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer-chamber</hi> was cited in Point.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Atkins pro Quer'.</hi> The <hi>scilicet</hi> being repugnant to what goes before is to be rejected as void; for what comes after, it is superfluous, and needed not to have been expressed at all; for the certain day of his death is not material. <hi>Vid.

               </p>
               <p>For else there would an uncertainty arise, which might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigle the Court, as not knowing who to give credit to; for

In 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> in <hi>Auditor Curles Case,</hi> it is said the <hi>King</hi> cannot make two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Officers of one and the same Office; but two Persons may constitute one and the same Officer; for then one cannot act without the other, 6 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> If the <hi>King</hi> grant an Office to one, and afterwards grant the same Office to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the second Grant is void for the reason above mentioned. So here, if there cannot be two Officers within the same place, at the same time, then the execution of the Writ in the Case at Bar by one, who is not an Officer there, was void, <hi>&amp; coram non Judice. Vide</hi> 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> the Case of the <hi>Marshalsey.</hi> And if it be a void Office, then the <hi>King</hi> is not entitled by it; for a void Office, and no Office at all, are one and the same; as in 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 46. <hi>b.</hi> A void Award, and no Award, are all one; and an Obligation to perform an Award, cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by not performing a void Award. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 28. <hi>b.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient return of a Sheriff, and no return at all, are all one. 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>b.</hi> 11 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Keilw.</hi> 199. held there, That if an Escheator feize by vertue of an insufficient Office, he is a Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passor and a Disseisor. 3 <hi>and</hi> 4 <hi>Eliz.

               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The Cases are not alike, for the Court does not take notice of Franchises, and the Sheriff is the Officer to the Court, notwithstanding the Franchise; and the Lord of the Franchise, is but a subordinate Minister to the Sheriff; but one Escheator is in no such subordination to another Eschea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; but they have severally the same Power within their Precincts.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(3)"/> AN Information sets forth, That at <hi>Gravesend</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> upon such a day, in such a Vessel, then and there riding, such a Person seized 206 <hi>l.</hi> 4 <hi>s.</hi> in Gold, from certain Persons unknown, then and there passing, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their passage in a certain Ship from <hi>Ratcliffe,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> to parts beyond the Seas. <hi>Wyche</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant came in and claimed Property, and pleaded that no Gold was found in any Vessel, by any passing, or upon their passage from <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> to parts beyond the Sea; and issue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned thereupon, a <hi>Ven' fac'</hi> was awarded from <hi>Ratcliffe,</hi> and a Verdict found for the <hi>Protector.</hi> Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> moved in Arrest of Iudgment, That the <hi>Ven'</hi> is not well awarded, for that it ought to have come from <hi>Gravesend</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where the Offence was laid to have been committed; for tho the Vessel is said in the Information to have come from <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe,</hi> that is not material, it is but a formal and no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial part of the Information; nor is there any answer to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52142:14"/> it, or Issue tendred upon it; and though <hi>Ratcliff</hi> had been materially named, yet since nothing is answered as to it, but only to what is laid at <hi>Gravesend,</hi> and Issue taken upon that, the <hi>Ven̄</hi> ought to have come from <hi>Gravesend</hi> and not from any other place. And admitting that the <hi>Venue</hi> ought to come from <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> yet it ought to come from <hi>Gravesend</hi> too, and the rather for that the Offence is laid there. And therefore here is a mistryal for want of a right <hi>Venue;</hi> and it is upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which is not aided by the <hi>Statutes of Jeoffails.</hi> 2. The Seizure here is mentioned to have been not by the Searcher, whom the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5. directs to seize, but by another person. And since that Statute fixes it upon a particular Officer, who is known and intrusted, no other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ought or has Authority to seize; and this appears likewise by the <hi>saving,</hi> which gives the Searcher power to allow the party his reasonable Expences, which no other has power to do. 3. The Issue is taken upon a <hi>disjunctive, passing or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their passage,</hi> and therefore it is ill; for those words do not signifie one and the same thing; they are not <hi>Synonyma,</hi> for one signifies the present, and the other the future tense: One betokens a readiness to pass, the other actual passing; and <hi>concluded for the Defendant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finch</hi> for the <hi>Protector.</hi> 1. The <hi>Ven̄ Fac̄</hi> is well awarded, because the Offence is a continued Offence and began at <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff.</hi> 2. This Disjunctive signifies but one and the same thing in common intendment. And if it were otherwise, yet in some Cases a Disjunctive has been allowed in an Issue, <hi>Hob. Rep. Keble</hi> and <hi>Osbaston's Case,</hi> and 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 43. <hi>b.</hi> In an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in the Exchequer for shipping Cloth without paying Custom for it: The Defendaat traversed, that the Custom was not concealed or withdrawn <hi>modo &amp; forma prout &amp;c.</hi> and Issue was taken upon this, and it was admitted to be a good Issue. 3. Any person may seize as well as a Searcher, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the common Good and the <hi>King's</hi> Profit, else the <hi>King</hi> might very easily be deceived and defrauded; and the Verdict supplies the defect, if it be one. <hi>Et adjornatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At another day in the same Term <hi>Windham</hi> argued for the Defendant: 1. A Searcher ought to seize; but no other person can. It was a Crime at the Common Law to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>Coin, Vid.</hi> 3 <hi>Inst.</hi> 92, 93. but not to be in passage with it. So it was an Offence for any Man to go beyond Sea without Licence; and yet it was not lawful for any to stop them; and by the Statute of 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>not printed,</hi> it was made <hi>Felony</hi> to transport <hi>Coin;</hi> but then came this Act of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. and confiscates it, if seized in the passage, and gives power to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52142:15"/> the Searcher to seize and allow to the party his reasonable Expences, which is a judicial Power; and the Exercise of it is called by the Act <hi>The Award of the Searcher, Hob. Rep.</hi> 245. <hi>Py</hi> and <hi>Westons Case:</hi> In an Information a Moiety was demanded, when only a third part was due, and held to be naught. <hi>Object.</hi> The Statute is only in the Affirmattve, that the Searcher may seize. <hi>Resp.</hi> It is a Trust and a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Power given to the Searcher, which is not transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: And the Statute is introductive of a New Law, <hi>Plo. Com.</hi> 113. a Diversity is taken when a Statute is introductive of a new Law, and when not: If it be introductive of a new Law, then no Man can act in that Affair, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what the Statute directs, and such an affirmative Statute implies a negative; otherwise if the Statute be but affirmative of, and additional to, what the Law was before: But this Statute here is introductive of a new Law, and therefore cannot be put in Execution but according to the true sense and meaning of the Act it self. 2. The <hi>second</hi> Point in the Case is, that here is a mistrial, and the <hi>Visne</hi> ill awarded: For the Offence is laid at <hi>Gravesend</hi> only; for it is said, that at <hi>Gravesend</hi> in a certain Vessel there the Party had seized this Gold to the use of the <hi>Protector,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the said Gold was then and there found in the possession of certain persons unknown, that were then and there in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to go from <hi>Ratcliff</hi> out of <hi>England;</hi> and it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the Gold was ever at <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> but at <hi>Gravesend</hi> only; nor does the Defendants Plea draw the <hi>Visne</hi> elsewhere. For the Plea is, that the said Gold was not found in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody of any person in passing in any Ship or Vessel going out of <hi>England.</hi> And the Law is very precise and curious in awarding <hi>Venues</hi> to the proper and nearest place to where the Fact was committed, 6 <hi>Rep. Arundels Case.</hi> Nor is this Case aided by any Statute. And admit that the <hi>Venue</hi> ought not to come from <hi>Gravesend</hi> only, yet it ought to come at least from <hi>Gravesend</hi> and <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> since the Counties of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Middlesex</hi> may well join, <hi>Vid. Hob. Rep. Cook</hi> and <hi>Clerks Case,</hi> 305, 306. concerning a way through three Vills, the Iury ought to come from all three, <hi>Vid. etiam</hi> 10 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
               <p>Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> on the same side. The Searcher only ought to seize; for the Statute is in the affirmative, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductive of a new Law, which makes it imply a negative. But an affirmative Statute that is in affirmance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law does not implie a negative.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finch</hi> for the <hi>Informer.</hi> 1. Any person may seize, <hi>quia pro bono publico;</hi> and nothing here is given to the <hi>Informer.</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52142:15"/> 2. If none can seize by Law but the <hi>Searcher,</hi> then it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied here that the Seizure in this Case was by the Searcher; for it is said, that the Gold was seized, and you say that none can seize but a Searcher. 3. The <hi>Venue</hi> is well awarded, and the Issue well joined upon a Disjunctive, 24 <hi>Car. B. R. Jenny</hi> and <hi>Frevil's Case,</hi> Pay or cause to be paid, put in issue; held to be well enough. And in the Statute of 21 <hi>Jac,</hi> of <hi>Jeofails,</hi> Informations for transporting Gold are excepted. As to the Case concerning a Way, that has beén objected; the <hi>terminus a quo</hi> is traversable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atkins</hi> on the same side. 1. The words of the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. are not compulsory, that the Searcher must, but may seize. 2. The Forfeiture doth not rise upon the Seizure, but upon the Offence, which began at <hi>Ratcliff.</hi> And in <hi>Py's Case, Hob.</hi> (before cited) the Information was held good for the King, though not for the Informer. 3. The <hi>Venue</hi> is well awarded; for the Act is transient, as in case of an Escape, it is an Escape in any County whereever the party comes, 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>acc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Attorny General</hi> argued to the same purpose: <hi>Et ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jornatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At another day the <hi>Barons</hi> all held that the Issue was well joyned, notwithstanding the disjunctive, because the parts of the disjunctive Proposition are Synonimous, <hi>Vid.</hi> 5 <hi>Rep. Dormer's Case.</hi> But they held the <hi>Visne</hi> to be misawarded, because all the Fact and Offence appeared to have been in <hi>Kent</hi> and not in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and the <hi>Venue</hi> must come from the nearest place. Whereupon a new <hi>Venire</hi> was awarded to the Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> returnable next Term in order to a Tryal at Bar. And a Tryal at Bar being had the next Term, there was a Verdict for the Defendant; and then a new Information was preferr'd in the Name of the <hi>Attorny General</hi> only for this Gold, and the Fact laid in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and a new Tryal at Bar ordered in <hi>Easter Term</hi> next: At which time a Tryal being had, there was another Verdict for the Defendant. And it was moved in Arrest of Iudgment; that the former Iudgment was not well entred; for the Entry was thus, <hi>Quia videtur Curiae hic quod prior Ven. facias erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice emanavit, ideo Venire de novo agard &amp;c.</hi> which is amiss; for it ought to have been, <hi>Quod prior Ven̄ Fac̄ and the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel be quash'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finch.</hi> The Iudgment ought to be arrested; for else there will be a double <hi>Ven̄ Fac̄</hi> upon the File <hi>simul &amp; semel;</hi> which must not be; for Presidents he cited <hi>Rastal's</hi> and <hi>Cook's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi> But otherwise it is, when a new <hi>Ven̄ Fac̄</hi> is awarded to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52142:16"/> supply a defect in a Verdict: For in that case there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault in the Court. And therefore in that Case the Entry is not <hi>Quod Ven̄ Fac̄ &amp; Pannellum cassentur,</hi> as is when the <hi>Ven̄ Fac̄</hi> is insufficient; for that is the Act of the Court. And he cited 9 <hi>Jac. B. R.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northumberland's Case</hi> in a <hi>Quo Warranto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Serjeant <hi>Maynard contr.</hi> The manner of Entry in such Cases is the Office of the Clerks, and the Iudgment of the Court is not requisite in such Cases; and Presidents vary: But it be amiss, it is but a mistake of the Clerk, which ought not in reason to avoid the Iudgment of the Court.</p>
               <p>At another day <hi>Turner</hi> argued for <hi>Wiche:</hi> The difference is when there is a Verdict given and when not; for if there be a Verdict given upon the <hi>Ven̄ Fac̄</hi> and recorded, there needs in that Case no formal Iudgment to quash the <hi>Ven̄ Fac̄</hi> if it be ill: But when there is no Verdict, such a Iudgment or Award of the Court is necessary; for else there would be a double <hi>Ven̄</hi> upon the Roll at one and the same time, upon which there might be two Tryals in one and the same Cause, which would be absurd: And with this difference the Presidents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <hi>Co. lib.

To which it was answered, that the words <hi>contra formam Statuti</hi> aided it; as in 14 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 312. In an Action upon the Statute for distraining <hi>averia ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rucae contra formam Statuti;</hi> it was not averred that there was a sufficient distress besides, and yet the Declaration held good. So in 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 13. Vpon a Ravishment of a Woman <hi>contra formam Statuti,</hi> without saying, <hi>She consented to the Ravisher,</hi> and yet adjudged good. <hi>Sed nota,</hi> These Cases do not come up to the Case in question; for in the former Case it must come on the other side, and in the second Case the <hi>Ravishment</hi> implies that she consented not; and therefore <hi>contra formam Statuti</hi> is sufficient in these Cases. But <hi>per Curiam contra for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam Statuti</hi> will not aid the Information in this Case; it being the most material part of the Act, which creates the Offence, and therefore ought punctually to be pursued, and Iudgment was arrested. But the Court would advise whether the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be that the party <hi>iret sine die,</hi> without the assent of the <hi>Attorny General.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Sheriff takes a Man in Execution for Debt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits him to the Gaoler of the County, at another place than where the Gaol is kept, and the Gaoler suffers him to escape, the Prisoner never having been in his custody at the place where the Common Gaol is kept, and it being usual for Sheriffs to commit Prisoners over to the Gaoler at other places than where the Common Gaol is; The question was, whether an Action upon this Escape will lie against the Gaoler, or ought to have been brought against the Sheriff?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hardres pro Quer'.</hi> I conceive an Action well lies against the <hi>Gaoler,</hi> or against the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> at the Plaintiffs Election. I agree, that at Common Law a Mans Body could not be taken in Execution upon a Recognizance or Iudgment but only in special Cases; as in Trespass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where a force and breach of the Peace is supposed. 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> 382. An Action of <hi>Debt</hi> does not lie against a Gaoler at Common Law, but only an <hi>Action upon the Case,</hi> which supposes a <hi>Tort</hi> and a <hi>Trespass;</hi> but where the Law makes the Body liable to be taken in Execution, there it is severe, and requires that the Prisoner be kept <hi>in salva &amp; arcta custodia,</hi> at his peril that has him in custody; and therefore the <hi>Statute. of</hi> 13 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>de Mercatoribus</hi> provides, that if upon a Statute Merchant the Debt be not paid at the day limited, and the Party be committed to prison, and the Keeper of the Prison will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, he shall be answerable for the Debt, if he be able, and if not, he that committed the Prisoner to his keeping shall answer for him. <hi>Vide etiam Stat. Westm.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. By which Statutes it appears, that the Law makes this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for the security of the Parties Debt in case of an <hi>Escape,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52142:21"/> viz.</hi> That he who actually suffers the <hi>Escape</hi> shall be liable in the first place; and if he be not able to make good the loss, then his <hi>Superior</hi> shall be responsible; so that the Gaoler, who has the Prisoner in custody, is far from being excused, but is liable as well as his Superior; nay, and in the first place. The Reasons of the Law may be these. 1. It is more natural and consonant to reason, which is the foundation of all Laws, That he who actually offends should be punished, then that another should be punished for him, and he who is the Offender be quit against him to whom he has done the wrong. 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. If a Prisoner <hi>escape,</hi> and the Gaoler retake him, he shall he in Execution again, for he that offended shall not be excused. <hi>Vide etiam</hi> 3 <hi>Rep. Rigeways Case, F. N. B.</hi> 130. <hi>b.</hi> If a Man committed to prison by <hi>Auditors of an Account,</hi> make his <hi>Escape,</hi> the Gaoler shall make satisfaction to the Party, and shall have a special Action upon the Case against the Prisoner to answer for the <hi>Escape,</hi> and the Damages that the Gaoler has sustained thereby, which Case comes up close to ours, and to the reason that I have urged. 3 <hi>Rep. Boytons Case,</hi> there it is laid down as a Rule, That by the Law every Man is to bear his own burden. A <hi>second Reason</hi> may be this; <hi>viz.</hi> An <hi>Escape</hi> is a <hi>Tort,</hi> a <hi>Wrong,</hi> and in the nature of a <hi>Trespass,</hi> which whoever commits must answer it in his own Person, and not another for him. <hi>Vide</hi> 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> 382. 15 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 322. <hi>a.</hi> 41 <hi>Ass.</hi> 15. 10 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 271. by which Books it appears, that an Action upon an <hi>Escape</hi> lies not against an Executor or an Heir, because it is a personal Tort and Trespass, for which therefore the Party must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer himself. 44 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 20. If a Mans <hi>Servant</hi> take Toll where it is not due, he himself shall answer it, and not his Master, by the Common Law. 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>b.</hi> 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 29. <hi>a.</hi> If a Mans <hi>Servant</hi> set a Dog on to bite a Man, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self shall answer it; so if my Servant put my Beasts into another Mans Ground. 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>vide</hi> 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>b.</hi> 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 23. If a Master commands his <hi>Servant</hi> to distrain for Rent, and he abuse the Distress, the <hi>Servant</hi> shall answer for it; and the reason of all these Cases is, because the Party that committed the <hi>Tort,</hi> ought in reason to answer for it, and make it good. A <hi>third Reason</hi> may be this, <hi>viz.</hi> The Law looks chiefly upon him that has the actual possession and charge of a thing, as the Person responsible for its forth-coming, 1 <hi>Inst.</hi> If any Person of his own Head takes the Profits of an Infants Estate, without any legal Authority, the Infant may charge him as his Bailee; <hi>Long quinto, fol.</hi> 70. <hi>b.</hi> Debt lies against the Successor of a Provost of a College, who is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52142:22"/> in <hi>de facto,</hi> tho he be not a righful Provost. 17 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>b. Quare non admisit,</hi> which is an Action grounded upon a Tort, and refusal, lies against a Gardian of the Spiritualities <hi>de facto;</hi> So here, if a Man be in possession of a Gaol, the Law looks upon him as the Party, that is immediately liable as Gaoler. <hi>Fourthly.</hi> The Law takes notice of Common Gaolers, as Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Ministers of Iustice; as appears 3 <hi>Rep. Boytons Case,</hi> and therefore <hi>Habeas Corpus s</hi> are frequently directed to them: and before the Statute of 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex't all Common Gaols to the Counties, they were Officers of themselves, and all Gaols belonged to the <hi>King,</hi> and not to the Sheriff; so that they are not meerly Servants, but Officers and Ministers that the Law takes notice of. <hi>Fifthly.</hi> My fifth Reason is grounded upon the general Rule of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Statutes made in such Cases; <hi>viz.</hi> Beneficially for the relief of the Parties grieved. <hi>Infancy</hi> and <hi>Coverture</hi> are greatly respected and favoured in the Law; and yet <hi>vide Whittinghams Case,</hi> 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 44. <hi>a.</hi> That if an Infant Gaoler suffer an <hi>Escape,</hi> an Action lieth against him, and that a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary <hi>Escape</hi> is a forfeiture of his Office. <hi>Plow. Com. Plats Case,</hi> 35. <hi>b. Stat.</hi> 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. Gives a <hi>Writ</hi> of Debt against the Gardian of the <hi>Fleet</hi> for suffering a Prisoner to go at large; and this <hi>Statute</hi> is by <hi>equity</hi> extended to all Sheriffs and Keepers of Gaols; and tho the <hi>Statute</hi> mention a <hi>Writ</hi> of Debt, yet a <hi>Bill</hi> of Debt is within the <hi>Statute.</hi> 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> 382.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> replies, That his cause of Action first began on the 22th of <hi>Nov.</hi> 7. <hi>Car.</hi> upon which day, and not before the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> demanded the said 60 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> of the <hi>Defendant,</hi> and that he began his Action within <hi>six years</hi> after, <hi>viz.</hi> The 1st of <hi>February,</hi> in the 12th year of <hi>King Charles,</hi> without that, that the said <hi>William</hi> in his life-time requested the <hi>Defendant</hi> to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and pay to the said <hi>William</hi> the said Monies paid to the said <hi>Stretton,</hi> by the said <hi>Battisford,</hi> as aforesaid, as the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant</hi> hath alledged, and that he is ready to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Howel pro Defendente,</hi> moved in arrest of Iudgment, and took four Exceptions; 1. To the <hi>Declaration.</hi> 2. To the <hi>Issue.</hi> 3. To the <hi>Verdict.</hi> And 4. for default of <hi>Notice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To the <hi>Declaration.</hi> Because the <hi>request</hi> mentioned to have been made by the Testator, is laid only by a <hi>saepius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitus;</hi> and when-ever a <hi>Request</hi> is requisit before an Action brought, being part of the promise, and as it were a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion precedent, there it must be particularly alledged, and not by a <hi>saepius requisitus. Vide</hi> 4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 274, 437. 1 <hi>Edit.</hi> where the <hi>Statute of Limitations</hi> was pleaded; so that for want of a sufficient <hi>Request</hi> laid, the Declaration is nought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the <hi>Issue.</hi> The <hi>Issue</hi> is taken upon the <hi>Traverse,</hi> which is, That the Testator did not <hi>request</hi> the Mony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52142:25"/> Defendant hath alledged. <hi>1.</hi> This is <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi> where it is mentioned, that the Testator was <hi>sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius requisitus,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>six years</hi> are not to be allowed after the Testators death, if the Testator himself made a <hi>request. 2.</hi> The <hi>Traverse</hi> is ill, because it comprehends the day upon which the Defendant alledgeth the Demand to have been made by the Testator; and the day is not material, and therefore ought not to have been made part of the <hi>Issue,</hi> as here it is; the <hi>Traverse</hi> ought to have been, <hi>absque hoc,</hi> that he made any request before or after within <hi>six years</hi> before the Action brought. <hi>Vide 7 Rep. Maunds Case, 21 Ed. 3. 42. vid. Bro. Traverse 69. 15 Ed. 4. 23. Bro. Traverse 165. 39 H. 6. 45. 2 Ed. 4. 16. Bro. Pleadings 9.</hi> besides, the <hi>Issue</hi> is <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>Declaration,</hi> as hath been said, and is therefore void.</p>
               <p>The <hi>3d. Exception</hi> was to the <hi>Verdict,</hi> which also is <hi>repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to the <hi>Declaration, Vid. 9 H. 6. 37.</hi> for the <hi>Declaration</hi> says the Defendant was <hi>saepius requisitus</hi> by the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and the <hi>Verdict</hi> says, That he never was requested by him at all. <hi>Vid. 33 H. 6. 30, 31.</hi> In Error in Maintenance, a Verdict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Record of the Declaration, void; so if contrary to the Confession of the Party, <hi>7 Ed. 4. 31.</hi> and Iudgment must be given upon the whole Record, as in <hi>8 Rep. Bonhams Case,</hi> and <hi>Turnors Case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>4th.</hi> Exception was for want of <hi>Notice. Notice</hi> ought to have been given to the <hi>Defendant</hi> of the Mony paid to <hi>Stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> because he is a Stranger to the whole matter. <hi>Vid. Hob. Rep. 51, 68.</hi> and concluded <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hardres pro Quer'.</hi> Four Exceptions have been taken in Arrest of Iudgment by the Councel of the other side; but I conceive that none of them are sufficient to arrest it.</p>
               <p>As for the first, which is to the <hi>Declaration,</hi> I agree to the Rule that has been laid down concerning when a <hi>special Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi> must be alledged, <hi>&amp; licet saepius requisitus</hi> is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and I agree that in this Case there ought to be a <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Request</hi> laid, and that <hi>licet saepius requisitus</hi> is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that being only the course and form of Pleading, and not traversable, <hi>Plow. Com. 128. b.</hi> in <hi>Buckleys Case.</hi> But now in our Case the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> does not insist, as the ground of his Action, upon any <hi>request</hi> made by the Testator, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the request made by himself, which is precisely alledged to have been made the <hi>22th</hi> of <hi>Nov. 7 Car. 1.</hi> and that <hi>request</hi> is the ground of the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Action. The Testators <hi>request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is put down only for form, and is no part of the ground of the Action; so that this Request made by the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> is enough for him, nor does any other cause of Action appear in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52142:25"/> the Case. And though the <hi>Declaration</hi> would be defective, if the Action were to be grounded upon a <hi>Request</hi> supposed to have been made by the Testator, yet it is full and particular as to the <hi>Request</hi> made by himself, and that's sufficient, which answers the Objection made on the other side. If a Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in an <hi>Action upon the Case</hi> upon a <hi>Promise</hi> to pay Costs of Suit, in which Case <hi>Notice</hi> is requisite, and having laid the Promise and what Costs were recovered, says that the Defendant <hi>praemissorum non ignarus</hi> (which is not a sufficient allegation) did not perform it, although the Defendant upon such a day had <hi>Notice,</hi> and lay it precisely, the <hi>Declaration</hi> is good by reason of the <hi>Notice</hi> being specially exprest in the following words, though the former words of themselves would not have been sufficient. So here, though the <hi>licet saepius requisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> be not sufficient, yet the special Request alledged afterwards is; and upon that this Action is grounded.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second Exception</hi> was taken to the <hi>Issue.</hi> I agree the Cases cited to prove that when the <hi>day</hi> is made parcel of the <hi>Issue,</hi> and is not material, the Issue is naught; and that it is good cause of <hi>Demurrer';</hi> though this is not so clear by the ancient Books, <hi>Vid. 19 H. 6. 9. 21 H. 6. 39.</hi> But in this Case of ours, the <hi>Traverse</hi> does not comprehend the day: We say only that the Testator did not <hi>request</hi> the Mony, <hi>as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant has alledged:</hi> In this <hi>Traverse</hi> there is not a word of the <hi>Day;</hi> but only 'tis said, <hi>as the Defendant has alledged,</hi> which goes only to the <hi>substantial,</hi> and not to the <hi>circumstantial</hi> part of the Plea, <hi>Vid. 19 H. 6. 7s 5 H. 5. 1. 39 E. 3. 1.</hi> It is a common Case, that if a Man in an Action of <hi>Trespass</hi> or an Action upon the Case upon a Promise, plead <hi>non culp.</hi> or <hi>non assumpsit modo &amp; forma,</hi> that this does not comprehend or extend to the day alledged, and therefore the <hi>Trespass</hi> or the <hi>Promise</hi> may be found to have béen made at any other time; but it comprehends only the substantial part of the Plea, <hi>Vid. Lit. 482, 483.</hi> for the words <hi>modo &amp; forma,</hi> that they are a Form of Pleading and not Words of Substance. And therefore in a Writ of <hi>casu consimili</hi> brought upon a supposed Alienation in <hi>Fee,</hi> if the Tenant plead <hi>ne aliena modo &amp; forma,</hi> and an alienation <hi>for Life</hi> be found, it sufficeth; yet that is not <hi>modo &amp; forma, Vid. Long. Quinto fol. 26. In Trespass sur 5 R. 2. Pasch. 1 Car. Ent. Hill. 21 Jac. Rot. 92.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> against <hi>Cornwallis.</hi> In Debt upon an Obligation bearing date <hi>30 Novemb. 20 Jac.</hi> conditioned to perform an Award, the Defendant pleaded that the Bond was <hi>primo <abbr>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberat</abbr>
                  </hi> on the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>April 21 Jac.</hi> after which day there was no Award made. <hi>Absque hoc quod cognovit se teneri &amp; firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52142:26"/> obligari modo &amp; forma prout &amp;c.</hi> This was held naught because the words <hi>modo &amp; forma</hi> went only to the date, which was no material or substantial thing; and the words <hi>modo &amp; forma</hi> do not comprehend any circumstantial part.</p>
               <p>And if the Law be so, then this Objection vanishes; for <hi>modo &amp; forma</hi> and <hi>as the Defendant has alledged</hi> are all one, and therefore these words shall not extend to comprehend the day, but the request, which is the substance of the Plea: And as in those Cases of <hi>modo &amp; forma</hi> the Iury may find the <hi>Request</hi> at another day; so in this Case, since the words <hi>as the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant has alledged</hi> refer to no more than <hi>modo &amp; forma</hi> does, they do not comprehend the <hi>day</hi> neither; so that the Issue here is well taken and could not be bettered.</p>
               <p>But admitting the day to be comprised, yet being after <hi>Verdict</hi> it is aided by the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Jeofails,</hi> as appears by these Cases, <hi>Vid. 5 Rep. Nichol's Case 43. Hob. Rep. Keble</hi> and <hi>Osbaston. Ibid. Napper <hi>versus</hi> Jasper</hi> and <hi>George. Ibid. Wood <hi>contra</hi> Buden. Pasch. 41 Eliz. C. B. Johnson <hi>versus</hi> Clerk.</hi> In Debt upon an Obligation the Defendant pleaded the <hi>Statute of Usury,</hi> and that the Plaintiff <hi>corrupte aggreeavit &amp; recepit &amp;c.</hi> and Issue was taken hereupon, and found for the Plaintiff, and aided, though the matter of the Issue were double, because there was an <hi>Issue,</hi> though more was in it than needed, and part of it took in an immaterial thing. Otherwise it is, when there is no Issue at all, there a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict does not mend the matter, <hi>Hob. Jennings <hi>contra</hi> Lee.</hi> In Battery the Defendant justified, the Plaintiff replied <hi>de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria sua propria,</hi> without saying <hi>absque tali causa;</hi> this was found for the Plaintiff, but not aided, because no Issue at all, being taken upon <hi>two affirmatives, Hob. Tasker</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Case</hi> in <hi>Trespass d' Ass.</hi> The Defendant justifies by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Plaintiffs coming upon his ground: The Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff replyed, that he was a Copyholder of the Mannor, and that the Lord had for himself and his Tenants of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs piece, a Way over the Defendant's piece, and Issue was taken thereupon, and found for the Plaintiff and not aided, because the Issue was impossible and so no Issue at all. But where the <hi>Issue</hi> is joined upon an <hi>affirmative</hi> and <hi>negative,</hi> though upon a thing that is not very material, yet it is aided after Verdict; and so in our Case, if the <hi>Day</hi> were comprised, yet there being a <hi>Verdict</hi> found for the Plaintiff, it is aided by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Jeoffails.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Case in <hi>7 Co. Maunds Case,</hi> the where day of the demand was traversed, does not come up to our Case; for there was a <hi>Demurrer,</hi> but we are here after <hi>Verdict.</hi>

               <p>A <hi>second Objection</hi> taken to the <hi>Issue</hi> hath been that it is <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>Declaration;</hi> for in the <hi>Declaration</hi> the Plaintiff alledges that the Mony was not paid, <hi>licet saepius requisitus</hi> by the <hi>Testator;</hi> and in his replication the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff says that the <hi>Testator</hi> made no <hi>Request,</hi> which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> This is no contradiction at all; for the words <hi>licet saepius requisitus</hi> are only words of form and meerly nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and surplusage; and are as if they had not béen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted; and then what is said contrary to an immaterial and insignificant part of the Count, will not amount to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, <hi>10 Rep. Osborn's Case 130.</hi> In an Action upon the Case upon a Promise to deliver <hi>diversa bona,</hi> viz. <hi>unum ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrum lecti,</hi> Anglice <hi>a Field-bedstead with a Testern and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Say,</hi> which is more than is in the <hi>Latin.</hi> Vpon <hi>non assumpsit</hi> pleaded, and Issue found for the Plaintiff, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire damages given; all was held good, because the rest was only nugatory and surplusage, and signifies nothing, and damages shall not be supposed to be given for what signifies nothing, <hi>22 H. 6. 46.</hi> In Debt upon an Obligation to perform an Award, if the Award be naught, it is as much as no Award at all and needs not be performed, <hi>10 Rep. Osburn's Case, 131. b. Plo. Com. 399.</hi> in the Earl of <hi>Leicester's Case.</hi> If a <hi>Custom</hi> be confirmed by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> which is void in Law, the <hi>Confirmation</hi> signifies nothing, because a <hi>void Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> and <hi>no Custom at all</hi> are both alike.</p>
               <p>So here the Allegation of a matter in Pleading, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing, and is inserted only as a form of Pleading, signifies nothing that the Court will take notice of; and then any thing alledged afterwards that's contrary to it, will not make a real contradiction, so as to vitiate the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>But admitting this to be a <hi>variance,</hi> yet not being <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> it is aided <hi>after Verdict, Mich. 15 Car. in B. R.</hi> The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal was in <hi>Trespass of Assault and Battery;</hi> and counts that the Defendant struck the Plaintiffs horse, whereby the Plaintiff fell; and this was held good, and no <hi>material va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance.</hi> This cannot be material, because <hi>licet saepius requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situs</hi> is only matter of form.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third Exception</hi> was to the <hi>Verdict</hi> for being contrary to what the Plaintiff has admitted in his Declaration; but this is answered already.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth Exception</hi> is for want of <hi>Notice</hi> that the Mony was paid to <hi>Stretton.</hi> But <hi>Notice</hi> in this Case is not requisite; the Case as to that is but thus, <hi>viz.</hi> A Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises

B. R. Collet <hi>versus</hi> Bayfield.</hi> Vpon a Treaty of Marriage, a Promise is made to the Father of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Father of the Son, to pay the Daughter <hi>100 l.</hi> after the death of the Son, if the survive him; the Father of the Daughter dies, the Son dies, the Administratrix of the Daughter's Father brought an Action upon this Promise, and <hi>per Curiam Notice</hi> of the Death of the Son needs not be given to the Father of the Son, <hi>Page <hi>versus</hi> Barnes, Pasch. 23 Car. B. R. Entr. Mich. 22 Car. R. 156.</hi> A Promise to pay so much Mony at the full age of an Infant; held that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his attaining his full age needs not be given, because it is as notorious to the one as the other: The like of the Marriage of <hi>I.

                  <hi>Trin. 23 Car. B. R. Bear <hi>versus</hi> Choldwich,</hi> In Debt upon an Obligation to pay so much Mony upon the Return of such a Ship from Sea, <hi>Notice</hi> of the Return neéds not be given. But where a thing lies more properly in the Conusance of the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> than of the <hi>Defendant,</hi> there <hi>Notice</hi> shall be given, as in the Cases that have been cited by the adverse party, <hi>viz.</hi> to give the Plaintiff so much for a Commodity as any other had before that time given him for the like; or to give so much for every Cloth the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> should buy; or to pay the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> what damages he had sustained by a Battery; or to pay the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Costs of Suit. In these and many other like Cases it has béen adjudged, that <hi>Notice</hi> must be given; for these are such things as lie most properly in Conusance of the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi> But so it is not in the Case at Bar: For how should he know how much a <hi>third</hi> person has paid to a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vener, better than the <hi>Defendant?</hi> Wherefore <hi>Notice</hi> here is not requisite. And prayed Iudgment <hi>pro Quer̄.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Trin. Term</hi> this Case was argued again by <hi>Howel pro Defendente</hi> and by <hi>Hardres pro Quer̄.</hi> But no new matter urged on either side. And the <hi>Court</hi> took it ill, that the same Council should argue the same matter twice. Afterwards the same <hi>Trin. Term</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> delivered their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>licet saepius requisitus</hi> was no material part of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> and therefore no contradiction in the Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52142:27"/> or Verdict. That the Words, <hi>as the Defendant has alledged,</hi> are but tantamount to <hi>modo &amp; forma;</hi> that if the <hi>Day</hi> be part of the <hi>Issue,</hi> yet that an <hi>immaterial Issue</hi> is aided after <hi>Verdict,</hi> if it be good in form. That <hi>Notice</hi> needs not, because the matter does not rest in the Conusance of the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> more than of the <hi>Defendant.</hi> And Iudgment was given <hi>pro Quer̄.</hi>

               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Easter Term</hi> 1656. the Court held there was no cause of <hi>Demurrer,</hi> and it was over-ruled, and the Parties proceeded to the hearing of the Cause, and the Merits were <hi>ut supra,</hi> with this That there was this farther Ground for the <hi>Decree, viz.</hi> That it appeared to the <hi>Court,</hi> that <hi>Baker</hi> and his Ancestors had been in possession 60 years, and that there were <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Non-claims</hi> after the Condition broken, and the Entry of <hi>Moulton,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Court decreed</hi> as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>The Cause being opened and debated, the <hi>Plaintiffs Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> urged, That there was no <hi>Fraud</hi> or <hi>Trust</hi> in the Case, but matter of <hi>Freehold</hi> and <hi>Inheritance,</hi> which is proper for a Tryal at <hi>Law,</hi> and not for a Court of <hi>Equity,</hi> without a Tryal at Law, especially in this Cause, wherein none of the Parties are entituled to the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of this <hi>Court,</hi> but only in respect of a Covenant with the <hi>King,</hi> to preserve the <hi>Kings</hi> Interest, who is a third Person; and there is no reason that a third Person should foreclose a Remedy at Law betwixt two others, when this Covenant does not at all concern one of them; and if there had been no such Covenant, it would not be denied but that the <hi>Decree</hi> ought to be reversed.</p>
               <p>On the other side it was urged, That this was a <hi>Court</hi> for the <hi>Kings Revenue,</hi> as well as a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Equity;</hi> and that it may and often does determine matters in <hi>Fait,</hi> where
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52142:32"/> the <hi>Court</hi> has a Iurisdiction without a Tryal at <hi>Law,</hi> where the Proofs are full, without doubt or difficulty, as a Custom for <hi>Multure, Tithes,</hi> and <hi>Parcel</hi> or not <hi>Parcel;</hi> and there are many Presidents in <hi>Court</hi> to this purpose: and they cited 11 <hi>Rep.

               </p>

                  <hi>Baron Nicholas,</hi> No <hi>Equity</hi> appears in the Body of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi> and therefore no <hi>Court of Equity</hi> can <hi>Decree</hi> it. <hi>The Earl of Worcesters Case,</hi> and <hi>Sir Moile Finchs Case,</hi> in <hi>Chancery, Mich.</hi> 41 and 42 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 4 <hi>Inst.</hi> 85.

               <p>The <hi>Mischiefs</hi> that would ensue, if this course were allowed, are these. 1. Tryals by <hi>Jury</hi> would be ousted. 2.

                  <hi>Resp.</hi> None of the <hi>Presidents</hi> that have been produced, come up to this Case in Point; but that in <hi>Hill.</hi> 45 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which is a <hi>President</hi> without <hi>President;</hi> and if there be one or two more, that might countenance such a <hi>Decree</hi> as this, two or threé <hi>Presidents</hi> ought not to prevail against the fundamental Rules of <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chief Baron.</hi> He held that the <hi>Court</hi> had a Iurisdiction of the Cause; but conceived that the <hi>Decree</hi> was erroneous for matter apparent. 1. He said there was a Title paramount the <hi>King,</hi> by vertue of the first Condition, which avoids the <hi>King's</hi> Title, 4 <hi>Rep. Sadler's Case,</hi> and a Covenant subsequent cannot controll that in <hi>Law</hi> nor in <hi>Equity.</hi> The Reasons given in this <hi>Decree</hi> confound it: <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi> are how shorter how better. 2. Here's a transmutation of <hi>Equity;</hi> there may be <hi>Equity</hi> for the <hi>King,</hi> but there's none for the Party; and the one shall not take advantage of the other's <hi>Equity:</hi> so that this <hi>Equity</hi> does not stand upon its right bottom.

               <p>Whether this were a good <hi>Charter of Incorporation,</hi> or a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly,</hi> within the Statute of <hi>21 Jac. cap. 3.</hi> was the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(3)"/> SIR <hi>Thomas Ashfield</hi> being <hi>sequestred</hi> for <hi>Recusancy,</hi> and two parts of his Lands in <hi>Buckinghamshire</hi> seized; In <hi>Easter-Term</hi> last he came in and pleaded that the Possession of the two parts ought to be no longer detained from him; for that he saith, that he is no <hi>Recusant,</hi> but is <hi>conformable</hi> to the Reformed Religion and Doctrin thereof professed in <hi>England</hi> according to the Laws in such Cases made and provided; and that he never refused to take the <hi>Oath of Abjuration</hi> specified in the <hi>Ordinance</hi> made the <hi>19th</hi> day of <hi>Aug. 1643.</hi> and for proof of such his <hi>Conformity,</hi> that on the <hi>22d</hi> day of <hi>Septemb. 1655.</hi> he took the said <hi>Oath</hi> according to the said <hi>Ordinance,</hi> as by Certificate and Oath appears; and that he hath frequented the publick Worship of <hi>God</hi> in the publick places thereof, and been present at the publick Ordinances of Prayers and Preaching there, as by <hi>Affidavit</hi> made appeareth. All which he is ready to averr, and thereupon prays to be discharged of the said Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration, and restored to his possession of the Premises.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the <hi>Attorny General</hi> craved advice of the <hi>Court.</hi> And the doubt was, Whether or no <hi>Conformity</hi> by a <hi>Recusant Convict</hi> were now a discharge? For that the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>1 Jac. c. 4.</hi> directs that such <hi>Conformity</hi> be registred and certified to the Bishop; and Bishops are now taken out of the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hardres pro Ashfield.</hi> The <hi>Act</hi> gives two parts to the <hi>King</hi> till <hi>Conformity,</hi> by one clause; and by another clause this <hi>Conformity</hi> must appear by the <hi>Bishop's Certificate.</hi> But though <hi>Bishops</hi> and all Powers and Authorities committed to them, be taken away, whereby this clause concerning the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate is in a manner abrogated, yet the Recusant's power of <hi>Conforming</hi> is not taken away; and then it is now to be taken as if it had béen enacted, that the party should forfeit two thirds till <hi>Conformity,</hi> and that no provision had béen made how his <hi>Conformity</hi> should appear. In which Case <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> must be tryed by the <hi>Common-Law,</hi> and not by <hi>Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate:</hi> For, whereever a <hi>Statute-Law</hi> gives or provides any thing, the <hi>Common-Law</hi> supplies all necessary Remedies and Requisites.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:52142:38"/>
               <p>The <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>2 E. 6. of Tythes,</hi> gives treble damages, but does not mention how, nor in what <hi>Court</hi> they shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: In which Case the Law supplies it; <hi>viz.</hi> by Action at <hi>Common-Law</hi> and a Tryal by Iury, as appears <hi>Co. Magn. Chart. upon this Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>7 E. 6. Dyer 83. a.</hi> By the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>32 H. 8. Tythes</hi> are made a <hi>Lay-Fee.</hi> Now by Exposition upon this <hi>Statute</hi> they shall be demanded, tryed and recovered as Lay-Fees. So here the <hi>Statute</hi> allows of a <hi>Conformity</hi> to be a discharge; but does not provide how this <hi>Conformity</hi> shall be proved. Why, the <hi>Common-Law</hi> shall supply that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Common-Law</hi> is the most ancient, general and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law of the Land. And the Priviledges of the <hi>Church</hi> derive themselves only from the Indulgence and Favour of <hi>Princes;</hi> and they had no foundation in the ancient <hi>Common-Law, ex. gra. Sanctuary,</hi> and some particular Tryals, that are left to them. And although the Priviledges of the <hi>Church</hi> are confirmed by divers Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that hinders not but that there was an ancient <hi>Common-Law,</hi> in which they had no bottom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>9 H. 7. 2. Profession</hi> of Religion is triable by the <hi>Bishop's Certificate;</hi> yet if the time of a persons becoming profest come in question, that is to be tryed by the <hi>Common-Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>45 E. 3. 18. 50 E. 3. 19.</hi> So <hi>general Bastardy</hi> or <hi>unques ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couple en loyal matrimony</hi> is tryable by the <hi>Bishop's Certificate.</hi> But <hi>special Bastardy,</hi> as whether one was born or begotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Espousals: Or whether a Woman be a Man's Wife or not: Or whether she were married to another before: These matters being specially alledged and put in Issue must be tryed <hi>per pais.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>41 E. 3. 37. 11 H. 4. fo.</hi> If the <hi>Bastardy</hi> or <hi>Profession</hi> of a third person come in question, or of a person that's dead, it shall be tryed <hi>per pais.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which Instances it appears that the Law of <hi>Holy Church</hi> had bounds set to it; and that it took place only in a Case of a general Allegation of <hi>Bastardy, Profession, Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty de matrimony</hi> or <hi>divorce;</hi> and that only so long as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was alive and a party to the Suit. And that in all other Cases the <hi>Common-Law</hi> retained its Iurisdiction; and more especially it ought in this Case so to do, where <hi>Holy-Church</hi> had <hi>no finger in the Pye,</hi> but by vertue of a Clause in an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which is now repealed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a natural and necessary implication in all Laws, which are nothing but refined Reason, that no Man ought to be punished more than his Offence deserves, but <hi>secundum
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52142:39"/> qualitatem personae &amp; quantitatem delicti;</hi> and this is the voice of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it self, <hi>cap. 14.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>4 Rep. Copihold Cases,</hi> If a <hi>Lord</hi> impose a grievous Fine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Copy-hold Tenant upon his admittance, the <hi>Court</hi> shall judge upon a Tryal at Law, whether it be so or not: And so it has beén often held.</p>

                  <hi>F. N. B. 75. a.</hi> If a Man be amerced for a Trespass or an Offence outragiously, a Writ <hi>de moderata misericordia</hi> lyeth, to the end that the reasonableness of it may come in question.</p>
               <p>So here; the intent and meaning of the Law was to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Vniformity in Religion, and to punish such as offend in dissenting from the Religion Established, so long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue obstinate. And this appears by the Case of <hi>Heresie</hi> upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>2 H. 4. c. 15.</hi> If a <hi>Heretick convicted</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, he should be received, and not be punished; but if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsed, he was to be burnt without more ado. So that that Law conform'd it self to the Law of <hi>God,</hi> who <hi>wills not the death of a Sinner, but rather that he should repent and be saved.</hi> And therefore it would be contrary to <hi>Reason</hi> and the Law of <hi>God,</hi> not to receive an Offender upon his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; or to deprive him of the benefit of his Repentance.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> If there be no means for a Man to have the benefit of his <hi>Conformity,</hi> there will be a <hi>failer of Justice,</hi> which must not be presumed. <hi>Nullum iniquum in lege praesumendum est.</hi> In such Cases the Law will strain hard to come at Right.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>2 R. 3. 4.</hi> In <hi>Trespass</hi> for taking of Goods, the <hi>Defendant</hi> pleaded a Will by which he himself was constituted Executor, and so entituled himself to the Goods in question, which had beén the Testators. The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> said, that after the Will made, whereby the <hi>Defendant</hi> was appointed to be Executor, the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor made another Will, wherein he appointed the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52142:39"/> be his Executor. The <hi>Defendant</hi> pleaded that the <hi>Pope</hi> by his <hi>Bull</hi> had delegated such a one to examin this matter, who had by sentence adnulled the Will, by which the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> claimed. It was resolved, that because this matter was not tryable by the Certificate of any Bishop of <hi>England,</hi> to whom the <hi>Court</hi> might write, that therefore some matter must be put in Issue triable <hi>per Patriam, ne deficiat Justitia.</hi> As in Case of a Deprivation by the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> or in case of a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> against the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> if the ability of the person come in question; these shall be tryed <hi>per pais,</hi> and they shall not be tryed by any inferior Ordinary. So if a <hi>Profession</hi> in the Order of St. <hi>John of Jerusalem</hi> be alledged, because there is none to whom the <hi>Court</hi> can write for tryal of it, it shall be tryed <hi>per pais.</hi> And the reason of all these Cases is, lest there should be a <hi>failer of Justice.</hi> Though these things are in their own nature tryable by the <hi>Bishop's Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate;</hi> yet where that cannot be had, they shall be tryed <hi>per pais.</hi> Now this is the <hi>Common-Law</hi> of the Land, and <hi>Magna Charta</hi> says, <hi>Nulli negabimus Justiciam.</hi>

Rot. 78.</hi> The question there was, whether or no the Tythes of a Parsonage were extendible by vertue of the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Westm. 2.</hi> Because now adays there can be no <hi>Bishop's Certificate</hi> that the <hi>Defendant nullum habet lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum feodum.</hi> But it was adjudged, that they were extendible, because it was only the permission and indulgence of <hi>Princes</hi> to give such a Priviledge to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> because of the <hi>Bishops</hi> who had a superintendency over the <hi>Clergy;</hi> but that now <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy</hi> being abolished, that Priviledge vanishes: And that <hi>Tythes</hi> for the future shall be subject to the Rules of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law.</hi> And the Rule in <hi>Slades Case 4 Rep.</hi> is <hi>recurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ad extraordinarium, quando non valet ordinarium.</hi> And <hi>in consimili casu consimile debet esse remedium.</hi> And it was held there likewise that where a <hi>Bishoprick</hi> is taken away, that <hi>general Bastardy</hi> and <hi>unques accouple in loyal, matrimony &amp;c.</hi> shall be tryed <hi>per pais,</hi> that there may be no <hi>failer of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi> So, I say, in our Case; <hi>Conformity</hi> must now be tryed by our Law, because there is no <hi>Bishop</hi> to certifie it.</p>

               <p>IN an <hi>English Bill</hi> for <hi>Multure</hi> due to the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Mill, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(5)"/> vertue of a Custom that all the Inhabitants in <hi>H.</hi> where the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Mill is, ought to grind all their Corn, Grain, Mault and Oatmeal to be used or spent, at the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Mill. After Answer and Depositions in the Cause, the question upon the hearing was, whether this was a good Custom or no? Because (as was objected) that (as the Custom was laid) no man could use, give or any way dispose of any Corn or Grain, but such as was ground at the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Mill; which seemed unreasonable. The <hi>Court</hi> ordered <hi>Presidents</hi> to be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52142:41"/> searched; and all the <hi>Presidents</hi> produced were of Decrées for Corn and Grain <hi>to be spent in their Houses.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Finch pro Defendente.</hi> The Custom here is an unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Custom, and Presidents cannot alter the Law. But a Custom to grind all the Corn spent in such an House at <hi>I.

But the Custom, as here it is laid, is naught; for it obliges the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to grind all their Corn <hi>spent;</hi> and this diversity was taken and judged in <hi>Alwood</hi> and <hi>Chalworth's Case in B.

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> and <hi>Stud. lib. 2. cap. 24.</hi> so far discusses the Point, as to hold that a Spiritual Consideration, or a Promise to build an Alms-house, or to do such an Act for the Honor of <hi>God,</hi> is not Obligatory, nor that an Action will lie for it; but the Ground there laid down is, That if he to whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is made have any Charge laid upon him, or any real Damage, or that the Party who makes the Promise has any benefit or profit, such a Promise doth bind in Law; but if neither of these happen, or the Party be in a worse Condition than before, it binds not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>10 Eliz. Dyer 272.</hi> A Master promiseth to two Men, that in consideration they had bailed his Servant out of Prison, he would save them harmless; this bound him not, because he had no benefit, nor they prejudice by his Promise; but if a Man promise to pay a Sum of Mony if <hi>J. S.</hi> will Marry his Daughter or Cosen, or because he has married her, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52142:43"/> who makes the Promise here has a benefit, <hi>sc.</hi> the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his Daughter, and the Consideration is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing one.</p>
               <p>Now let us examine the present Case by this Rule. Where is the Cause or Consideration meritorious, which deserves such a Recompence? Or where is the benefit that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miser receives by it? Or where's the prejudice of him to whom the Promise is made? That the Promiser has no benefit is clear, for he is a <hi>Stranger</hi> to the Debt, and no way liable to the Iudgment; so that the validity of the <hi>Consideration</hi> must consist in the prejudice that he sustains to whom the Promise is made, or else it is no where to be found: Now his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice can be pretended to be no other than he receives by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance to prosecute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> promise of forbearance can be no good Consideration, unless it be prejudicial to one, or beneficial to the other. <hi>Mich. 6 Car. B. R. Morgans Case,</hi> A Lessee promised in Consideration the Lessor would forbear to distrain his Corn unshocked, he would pay his Rent that was due; adjudged to be no Consideration, because such Corn is not distrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trin. 2 Car. B. R. Goodwin <hi>versus</hi> Willoughby. A.</hi> promiseth to pay a Debt upon Account, and dies; his Wife promiseth in consideration of forbearance to pay the Mony, when she should have received such a Debt; this does not bind the Wife, unless she were Executrix or Administratrix, or chargeable with the Debt.</p>
               <p>

Lee <hi>versus</hi> Newcombe.</hi> In Error of a Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an Inferior Court, the <hi>Defendant</hi> promised that if the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> would accept the <hi>Defendant</hi> for his pay-Master, for a Debt due to the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> by a <hi>Stranger,</hi> and would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the <hi>Defendant 6</hi> months, that he would pay the Debt; adjudged to be no consideration, because the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> might sue the <hi>Stranger</hi> notwithstanding, and therefore is at no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, which is a strong Case to our purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mich. 1651. B. sup. Hummers <hi>versus</hi> Hunton.

This was adjudged to be no <hi>consideration,</hi> because she was not liable to any Suit, so that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had no prejudice by such forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:52142:44"/>
               <p>So that it appears clearly that where the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> is at no prejudice, nor the <hi>Defendant</hi> recieves no benefit by forbearance; there <hi>forbearance</hi> is no <hi>consideration</hi> to ground an Action upon.</p>
               <p>But now in our Case the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> has no real prejudice by such forbearance of Suit by himself, who has but a Letter of Attorny to prosecute in another Mans Name, and receive the Mony to his own use; for though he forbear to prosecute, yet the Party himself to whom the Debt is owing may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute in his own Name, and recover the Debt, and may permit and suffer the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> to have the benefit of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purport of his Letter of Attorny; so that neither the <hi>Defendant</hi> has any benefit by this forbearance, nor the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> a prejudice by his <hi>Cesser;</hi> and therefore here is no good <hi>consideration,</hi> no more than in the Ease before cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Lee</hi> and <hi>Newcombe.</hi>

               <p>But if it had been in consideration that the Party himself, to whom the Debt was owing, would forbear Suit, such a Promise would have been good; but as it is, it is no more than if an Obligor should promise to pay the Debt due upon the Bond, if a Stranger would forbear to sue, for the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> here is in effect a Stranger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pasch. 1651. Pet <hi>versus</hi> Bridgewater,</hi> was our very Case. The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> there had a Letter of Attorny to receive a Debt to his own use, as here, and power to release and discharge it, which the Plaintiff here has not (for ought appears) and there the <hi>Defendant</hi> promised, that if he would forbear to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the Suit, he would pay him the Debt; and it was moved in Arrest of Iudgment there, as it is here, that there was <hi>no consideration,</hi> because what the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> does must be in another Mans Name, and the Debt remains due to another Person, who may sue and prosecute for it in his own Name, notwithstanding the Letter of Attorny. And the <hi>Chief Justice Roll</hi> said in that Case, That it appeared that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had power to discharge and release the Debt, which is for the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants</hi> advantage; and therefore he held it to be a good <hi>consideration,</hi> but said it would have been otherwise, if the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had had no such Authority, which in our Case he has not, at least it does not appear that he has; so that this Case is a Case in point for the <hi>Defendant;</hi> wherefore he prayed for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> that the Iudgment might be <hi>arrested.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And afterwards the <hi>Court</hi> was of Opinion that the <hi>conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> was sufficient, and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had his <hi>Judgment.</hi>

               <p>Now consider our Case, The County of <hi>Berks</hi> is in the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> which is direction for all that ensues; and upon an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition taken of Lands in this County, the Party comes in and pleads to part of the Lands so taken, and sets forth his Case, <hi>viz.</hi> That the outlawed Person was endebted to him, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had Iudgment by <hi>non sum Informatus</hi> in the <hi>Com. B.</hi> at <hi>Westm. in Com. Middlesex,</hi> and chuses, and prays a Writ of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git</hi> to the Sheriff of the County aforesaid, at the return whereof <hi>Henry Herne</hi> Sheriff returns an Inquisition taken at <hi>Wanting</hi> aforesaid, in the Country aforesaid, and delivers him a moiety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the value of <hi>10 l.</hi> and avers the Land pleaded unto, to be parcel of his moiety; In this Case, putting all these
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52142:46"/> things together, it cannot possibly be understood that <hi>Com. praedict.</hi> should relate to <hi>Middlesex,</hi> for there is no discourse nor occasion ministred of any thing done in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> but all the matter and the whole dispute arises concerning these Lands, and it cannot be presumed that the Sheriff of <hi>Middlesex</hi> should execute an <hi>Elegit</hi> of the Lands <hi>in Com. Berks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, the Plea is good to a common Intent, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enough.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3d. Obj.</hi> It does not appear by the Plea, but that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant</hi> is satisfied his Debt by perception of Profits, and he does not aver that he is not satisfied, <hi>31 Ass. 28. in point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> He cannot be satisfied by common Intendment, for the Lands extended upon the <hi>Elegit</hi> are but of <hi>10 l.</hi> yearly value, and the Debt is <hi>605 l.</hi> and he has but been two years in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and if there has hapned any satisfaction by casual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, which is not to be presumed, it must come on the other side. Till that appear what we have alledged is sufficient.</p>
               <p>At another day, this same Term, the Matter of the <hi>3d. Obj.</hi> was argued at the Bar by <hi>Hardres pro Defendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It appears upon Record, that the <hi>Extent</hi> upon the <hi>Elegit</hi> was the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>October 1652.</hi> for <hi>605 l.</hi> Debt, and Costs of Suit, and that the Lands were extended but at the value of <hi>10 l. per annum,</hi> and that they had been but two years in <hi>Extent</hi> at the time of the Plea pleaded, being <hi>Michaelmas Term 1654.</hi> so that it is not possible the Debt should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by the extended value.</p>
               <p>There has been objected the Book of <hi>Assizes 31 pl. 28.</hi> and <hi>Bro. sur ceo, Pleadings 63.</hi> That such averment is necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> That Book does not warrant any such Rule; the Case is no more than thus, <hi>viz.</hi> In <hi>Assize</hi> the Tenant as to parcel pleaded a Recovery in a former <hi>Assize</hi> against the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff;</hi> and to the residue he pleaded an <hi>Extent</hi> upon an <hi>Elegit,</hi> for Damages recovered in the former <hi>Assize</hi> to <hi>5 l.</hi> and that the Lands were delivered to him <hi>tanque, &amp;c.</hi> and that the Mony was not yet satisfied; <hi>Judgment si Assize, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> replied, That the Lands extended were his, but the Damages for which they were extended, were recovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another Person; this is the effect of the Book.</p>
               <p>Which does not warrant that of necessity there must be such an Averment; nor is there any Rule laid down in the Book concerning the Matter: But <hi>Bro.</hi> in his <hi>Abridgment</hi> observes, that so it is pleaded in divers places in the <hi>Book of Assizes,</hi> and thence concludes that it must be pleaded in like manner, or that the Pleading is vicious, which is a meer <hi>non sequitur,</hi> that because it has been oftentimes pleaded, therefore it is of necessity to be pleaded.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:52142:46"/>
               <p>Besides, there is a mistake in saying that it has been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally pleaded; for in that very year, <hi>viz. 31 Ass. pl. 13.</hi> In an <hi>Assize</hi> for Rent, the Tenant pleaded, that before the Grant of the Rent there was an <hi>Elegit</hi> sued out upon a Iudgment for <hi>100</hi> Marks, and the Lands extended <hi>quousque,</hi> and assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to himself, and that the <hi>Demandants</hi> Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> granted and confirmed to him for life; and the Plea was admitted to be a good Plea: But the question was, whether it was not <hi>double? sc.</hi> The <hi>Elegit</hi> and the Grant, before the grant of the Rent, for which the <hi>Assize</hi> was brought; so it is not always pleaded, as <hi>Brook</hi> says.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> It was necessary, for any thing that appears to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to set it forth in <hi>31 Ass. pl. 38.</hi> because the Debt was but <hi>5 l.</hi> and it does not appear how long the Land had been extended, so that perhaps the time was passed, within which the Debt might have been run up, and then without doubt the <hi>Defendant</hi> ought to plead so, if he would hold over.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Admitting that it had been most usually pleaded, yet it does not follow, that <hi>de jure</hi> it must be so pleaded.</p>
               <p>It is usually said in the Declaration, in an <hi>Action upon the Case,</hi> and <hi>Debt, licet saepius requisitus;</hi> and yet in <hi>Plow. Com. Buckleys Case,</hi> it is said to be but a form of Pleading, and that if it be omitted, it does not vitiate the <hi>Declaration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Avowries</hi> it is usually said <hi>&amp; hoc parat est varificare,</hi> and yet it is not necessary, <hi>3 Mar. Bro. Averment 81.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the inserting of words into Forms of Pleadings, is not always an Argument that therefore they are necessary; and the Law is so that they cannot be omitted.</p>
               <p>It has been farther objected, that it is in the nature of a <hi>Condition precedent,</hi> and therefore must be averr'd</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> That is a mistake; for the Commencement of the Estate does not depend upon the Debt being satisfied, but the Estate is to determine upon it: the Estate is created by Extent, and is not to expire till the Debt be satisfied, and therefore the continuance of it needs not be averred. As <hi>7 Rep. Ughtreds Case,</hi> A Man is made Captain of a Fort for his life, and an annuity granted to him for the Exercise of the Office; In an Action for this Annuity, the Plaintiff needs not aver that he has exercised the Office, for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity would determine upon his not executing it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that must come on the other side, being a <hi>Condition sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent;</hi> and in all Cases of <hi>Condition subsequent,</hi> the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> declares generally without any <hi>Averment;</hi> and the breach of the Condition must be alledged by him that will take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it; it is matter <hi>ex post facto;</hi> and every Man in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52142:47"/> must alledge that that makes for himself only, and is for his avail, and shall not be driven to alledge what makes against him, which is a strong Case to our purpose; for it does not make for the <hi>Defendant</hi> to alledge that the Mony is paid, no more than in the other Case that he had exercised the Office; the payment of the Debt is not for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>Extender, &amp;c.</hi> but for the benefit of the other Party.</p>
               <p>In <hi>2 H. 7. 8. b.</hi> there is a notable Case to this purpose, The <hi>King</hi> granted a Patent directed to the <hi>Clark</hi> of the <hi>Hana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> to pay such a Sum of Mony to the Patentee, <hi>receiving an Acquittance</hi> for the same; the Patent was shewn to the <hi>Clark;</hi> and in an Action of Debt for non-payment, it was held and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> need not <hi>aver</hi> that he offered an <hi>Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> but the other ought to have demanded it; and that it was sufficient for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> to say that he shewed him his Patent, because it was for the Defendants advantage to alledge that he demanded an Acquittance, and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here it is for the advantage of the other side to alledge that the Mony was received and paid.</p>
               <p>But it is observed that it is as necessary to make this <hi>Averment,</hi> as it is to aver the life of a <hi>Cesty que vie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The Cases are not alike, for there the Life is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of the Estate, and not a collateral determination of it, as in our Case.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Authorities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">

               </p>
               <p>Vpon all which Books it appears, that if the party whose Lands are extended, will avoid the <hi>Extent,</hi> he must avoid it by surmise upon <hi>Record;</hi> and that the surmise of satisfaction must come on the other side, as more proper for him; and if so, it will necessarily follow that the <hi>Extender</hi> néeds not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that he is not satisfied. Nor shall he be here in a worse condition, because the <hi>Protector</hi> claims under the party, whose the Lands are. Whereupon he prayed Iudgment <hi>pro De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon this Argument the <hi>Barons</hi> were of opinion that such <hi>averment</hi> is not necessary; because the payment of the Mony is not the creation, but the determination of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, which in Iudgment of Law is certain by the extended Value. <hi>Et casus fortuitus non est supponendus.</hi> And that this Case differs from that of a Lease for years, if such an one so long live; for the continuance of that life, is the very Essence of the Continuance of the Estate. <hi>Et adjornatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Hill. Term</hi> it was argued by <hi>Finch</hi> for the <hi>Protector.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He agreed to the Case <hi>15 H. 7. 15.</hi> And that if the Plea had beén pleaded in Bar to the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> the <hi>Averment</hi> would
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52142:48"/> not have been necessary: But the Case of <hi>Prerogative</hi> differs from that of a <hi>Subject,</hi> as in the Case of a <hi>Condition subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, 1 H. 7. 24. 38 H. 6. 34.</hi> Grant <hi>ad effectum, &amp;c.</hi> is a <hi>Condition</hi> and must be pleaded, <hi>Hob.

               <p>For <hi>Reasons. 1.</hi> All Pleas shall be taken most for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors</hi> advantage.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The Execution of the <hi>Elegit</hi> is not well pleaded. The Writ of <hi>Elegit</hi> appears to have beén taken out thrée years after <hi>Judgment</hi> given, and there is no <hi>Averment</hi> of <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances;</hi> so that it did <hi>erronice emanare.</hi> And such an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall not bind the <hi>Protector.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hardres pro Buckeridg.</hi> It is now at last admitted to me by the other side, that, if this Plea were betwixt party and party, it would be a good Plea without the <hi>averment</hi> contended for; and that then it must come on the other side to alledge the Debt satisfied. But the Objection now made is, that this being in the <hi>Protector's</hi> Case, the Prerogative will make a difference: To which I give this Answer, <hi>viz.</hi> that I do not find in any Book of Law, that the <hi>King's Prerogative</hi> will enforce the Subject to alter the nature and manner of his Plea.</p>
               <p>I agrée the <hi>Protector</hi> may alter his own Count or Plea, or waive it and demur; so he may waive his Demurrer and plead. But if he will alter his Declaration, it must be in the same Term, and not in another Term if the party has pleaded to it; nor after Issue joyned, <hi>13 E. 4. 8. 28. H. 6. 2. 5 Rep. 105. a.

               </p>
               <p>But to compel or enforce the Subject to alter the Nature and Form of his Pleading; such a <hi>Prerogative</hi> is not to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reasons. 1.</hi> This would be to alter the Law it self, which the <hi>King</hi> cannot do, though he has many <hi>Prerogatives</hi> allow'd him by Law.</p>

                  <hi>3d Reason.</hi> If the Law were otherwise, it would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce doubt and uncertainty, and the Subject would be at a loss for want of a certain Rule.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The Cases cited are not like to ours, nor stand upon the same Reason. I agrée the Case, that where the <hi>King</hi> erects a Court in a Mannor to do Iustice there, or gives Lands upon Condition to give them to a Nunnery to be erected, or to provide a Chaplein, as in the Cases that have beén quoted; the Patenteés must in Pleading <hi>aver</hi> the Performance of the Conditions, because they are the grounds and considerations of the Patents, which unless they appear to be performed, the Estate is gone.</p>

But here we are not in any such Case; but in a Case upon the <hi>Stat.</hi> of <hi>Westm. 2.</hi> that gives the <hi>Elegit,</hi> and subjects the Lands of the Debtor upon a reasonable <hi>Extent</hi> and value, to Execution till the Debt be satisfied; and as I said before, gives to the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> a certain Estate by computation of time. And it appears here upon <hi>Record,</hi> that that time is not yet expired, nor can be, whereas no such thing appears upon <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52142:49"/> in the Cases that have been objected; and the payment is collateral to the Estate, and must come in by surmise of the other Party, and that as well in the <hi>King's</hi> Case, as in the Case of a common person.</p>

                  <hi>2d Object.</hi> It is likewise objected that here is no good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution by <hi>Elegit;</hi> because the <hi>Elegit</hi> went out three years after the <hi>Judgment</hi> entred, and there are no <hi>Continuances,</hi> that appear at least; and so the <hi>Elegit erronice emanavit;</hi> and that of this the <hi>Court</hi> ought to take notice.</p>

                  <hi>Resp.</hi> There is a <hi>privity,</hi> for he claims under the Lessor <hi>per formam doni.</hi> Also the Act of Parliament creates a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> because it gives the Rent, to him, to whom the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion goes; and <hi>Sury</hi> and <hi>Browns Case,</hi> and <hi>Mallories Case,</hi> 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> confirmed this; nor does <hi>Whitlocks Case,</hi> 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> make against this, it gives only advice; but <hi>Austens Case, Dyer</hi> 115. seems to be a Case in Point, and so the <hi>Abridger</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves by a <hi>Nota;</hi> and 1 <hi>Inst.</hi> 46. agrees.</p>
               <p>So that I hold the Lease to be made pursuant to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the <hi>Statute,</hi> and that it is a good Lease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Parker accordant.</hi> 1. It is the Office of a <hi>Judge</hi> to preserve, and not to destroy an Estate, if the Exposition be not contrary to the words; as appears in <hi>Altonwoods Case,</hi> 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> of a <hi>Grant.

Lit.</hi> 236. 5. <hi>Rep.</hi> 15. <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 76. <hi>Co. Mag. Chart.</hi> 84, 110. If the <hi>Reservation</hi> had been to the <hi>Heir</hi> of the Tenant in Tail only, it had been good, as was adjudged in <hi>Skid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores Case.</hi> So a Lease for 99 years, if three Lives so long live; and <hi>Rent</hi> reserved shall ensue the nature of the Land, and go accordingly. <hi>Whitlocks Case,</hi> 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> has no influence upon the Case in question; but <hi>Wyats Case, Dyer</hi> 115. is full in the Point. And there is a diversity where the Person
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52142:54"/> to whom the Rent is reserved is capable of it, and where not; where the Person is capable, the Rent shall go according to Reservation, as <hi>during the Term to the Lessor and his Assignes.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Here is a Clause of <hi>Re-entry</hi> reserved for <hi>non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the Rent to the <hi>Heirs</hi> of the Lessor, which shews the intent of the Parties to have been, that the Rent should go accordingly to the <hi>Heirs general.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> No Implication shall prevail against express words; and that Clause is no part of the Reservation, and the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as strong to the contrary; for the Heirs at Law may enter for a Condition broken, and yet another Person enjoy the Estate, upon and by vertue of their Entry; and concluded <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Nicholas accordant</hi> for four Reasons. 1. Because the words <hi>during the Term,</hi> without more, would have been enough; as appears by the Books, 14 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 26. 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 14. 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Dyer</hi> 45. <hi>Co.

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But the words that follow, <hi>viz. to him and his Heirs,</hi> are restrictive of the words that go before,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> When there are two Clauses in a Deed, of which the later is contradictory to the former, there the former shall stand; as in 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2 <hi>Feoffments &amp; Faits,</hi> 24. 4 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 22. of a Gift in <hi>Frank-marriage,</hi> rendring Rent, the Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is void.</p>

                  <hi>Chief Baron Widdrington accordant,</hi> upon four Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 1.

               <p>The <hi>1st. Object. a simili</hi> is the Case of <hi>Felons Goods</hi> seized; and the <hi>Statute of 1 R. 3. c. 3.</hi> which provides, that if a Man be arrested or imprisoned for Felony, no Officer shall seize his Goods before Conviction, according to the Law of the Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The Answer is clear, and so declared by the very Act it self, which is <hi>Lex terrae;</hi> and so <hi>Stamford pl. Cor. 193. b.</hi> tells us, that that <hi>Statute</hi> is but a <hi>Confirmation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law,</hi> with which <hi>Bracton</hi> agrees, who is there cited, <hi>f. 52.</hi> That in such a Case a Writ lies to deliver the Goods upon security, and there is great reason for it, <hi>to wit,</hi> The Suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Persons in Prison, who have no Estates of their own, but depend upon Labour, and live by that when they are out of Prison. But that <hi>Statute</hi> extends only when the Party is in <hi>Prison;</hi> for if he be at large, he is not within this Law, but the Officer may seize, and that by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>25 Ed. 3. c. 14.</hi> called the <hi>Statute de proditoribus,</hi> that upon the <hi>2d Capias</hi> the Sheriff may seize, though there be no forfeiture till the <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;</hi> by which it appears that this is the settled Law of the Land, by which the <hi>Felon,</hi> in the first Case, is to have his Goods;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52142:56"/> but in the Case at Bar there is no positive Law, <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Statute,</hi> in the Case.</p>
               <p>A <hi>second Objection</hi> has been made, That when Goods are seized after <hi>Outlawry,</hi> yet upon pleading and giving security, they shall be restored to the Party, though forfeited; and for the same reason it ought to be so in the Case in question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> It has always been practised so in the Case objected, nor was it ever denied; but in the Case in question <hi>restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> has been frequently denied; and many times there is good reason why it should be denied; and <hi>Presidents</hi> in one Case, unless they be <hi>ad idem,</hi> are no Guides in other Cases.</p>
               <p>The <hi>3d. Objection</hi> grounded upon Presidents and Vsage <hi>ad idem,</hi> may receive a double Answer.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> As for <hi>Usage</hi> and <hi>constant Practice,</hi> I agree that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Vsage, and the course of the Court, is the Law of the Court and of the Land. <hi>2 Rep. 17. Lanes Case.</hi> But where the <hi>Usage</hi> and <hi>course of a Court</hi> is not constant and certain, there it is otherwise; for an Vsage or Custom interrupted and discontinued not once or twice, but often, cannot be termed Vsage or Custom; for it is of the Essence of an Vsage or Custom to be <hi>semper;</hi> for as continuance makes it, so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance destroys it.</p>

                  <hi>28 H. 8. Dyer 30.</hi> Copy-holds must be always demised or demisable.</p>
               <p>My <hi>2d. Answer</hi> is, That <hi>Presidents</hi> without a Iudicial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination do not make a Law. <hi>4 Rep. Slades Case 94.</hi> resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That <hi>Presidents</hi> not made upon a Iudicial debate, but that pass as it were <hi>sub silentio,</hi> do not make a Law, <hi>&amp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo errantium non parit errori patrocinium, Vide etiam Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons Case, 4 Rep. 32. b. 6 Rep.</hi> Sir <hi>John Molins Case, fol. 6. ibid. fol. 73.</hi> Sir <hi>Drue Drury's Case. 11 Rep. 75. Magdalen Colledge Case.</hi> By all which Cases it appears that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents</hi> not grounded upon Debates and judicial Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are not of force enough to be Directions to a Court of Iustice.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> I answer, That in this Case there are <hi>Presidents pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> in all times, and therefore no argument to be drawn from them.</p>
               <p>Now to give an Answer to some Reasons of Law that have been offered to prove these Writs due <hi>ex debito Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 1.</hi> Any Man may seize, and any thing may be seized upon such a Suggestion and Information, which is a great inconvenience, that Mens Properties should be so invaded whilst it remains doubtful whether there be any forfeiture or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52142:56"/> not till Iudgment, and the Owners have no remedy in the mean time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> This Objection may be answered by an Argument <hi>à pari,</hi> and thus retorted, <hi>viz.</hi> If any one may seize, then every <hi>Merchant</hi> may before any body else by intendment can know any thing of the Matter, set up an <hi>Informer,</hi> who may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to, or not oppose the <hi>Writ of Delivery,</hi> and not prosecute afterwards; and no other Informer perhaps can, because not privy to the Evidence, by which means the <hi>Common-weatlh</hi> may be defrauded; and there is as much reason that the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> which by presumption will do no Injustice, should have the custody of the Goods, as a private Owner, when there is a dispute whether they be forfeited or not.</p>
               <p>So that there being inconveniences on both sides, what Arguments can be drawn from thence to prove these Writs due <hi>ex debito Justiciae?</hi> Which is as much as to say, that it is Injustice in the <hi>Court</hi> to deny them, though how to make it Injustice to deny them, where the <hi>Presidents</hi> are <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> and inconveniences equal on both sides, and no positive judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial President to direct the <hi>Court</hi> in what Cases to grant them, and in what not, I cannot comprehend.</p>
               <p>For certainly what is demandable, <hi>ex debito Justiciae,</hi> ought to be grounded upon some direct and positive Law, or upon some undeniable reason, such as that of <hi>Magna Charta, nullus liber homo, &amp;c.</hi> or upon multitudes of judicial Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all Ages.</p>
               <p>Nor can these Writs be concluded to be <hi>ex debito Justiciae,</hi> though there may have been one or two Iudgments in point; for we see by daily experience that <hi>Courts</hi> may err in Iudgments; else how comes it to pass that so many Iudgments are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards drawn in question, and many Iudgments given upon debate, contradicted and reversed?</p>
               <p>I will cite only two <hi>Presidents,</hi> and those fresh in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Attorny General <hi>versus</hi> Andrews, Trin. 1656.</hi> The question was, whether the <hi>King</hi> should be preferr'd before a <hi>Subject,</hi> who has a Iudgment and execution for his Debt? And adjudged that he should not, if the Subject sued out Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion first, although a Iudgment of this <hi>Court</hi> was cited to the contrary in point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mich. 1656.</hi> The <hi>Protector <hi>versus</hi> Geering.</hi> The question was whether one as <hi>Amicus Curiae</hi> might quash an Inquision; and adjudged clearly that he might, though a Iudgment in this Court was cited to the contrary: by which Cases, and many others of the like nature, it appears that <hi>Judges</hi> are
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52142:57"/> not bound by the Iudgments of their Predecessors; and it would be mischievous if it were otherwise; <hi>to wit,</hi> That one should be concluded by the Opinion of another <hi>in aequali gradu</hi> with himself: but when there are diversities of Opinions, and a Point settled upon solemn Debates, the Case may be different.</p>
               <p>Now to conclude, since the Argument <hi>à simili</hi> cannot hold in these Cases to tye up the Hands of the <hi>Court,</hi> since <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> are <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> since there are no judicial Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Case, in what Cases such Writs are to be granted, and in what not, since the inconveniences are equal on both sides; and since the Iudgment given in <hi>23 Car.</hi> rather makes against the right of demanding these Writs than for it, What is to be done in such a Case? Why, certainly the <hi>Court</hi> according to their discretion must be Vmpire, the <hi>Judges</hi> being indifferent Arbitrators betweén the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> and the <hi>Subject;</hi> and being intrusted with the Declaratory Power of the Law <hi>secundum bonam &amp; sanam discretionem.</hi> And to them I submit this Case, it being most fit for them to provide due remedy both for the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> and the <hi>Subject,</hi> so as neither may be defrauded or defeated of their just Rights.</p>

               <p>It is a Contradiction, that the Goods should be forfeited, and yet the <hi>Protector</hi> recover only Damages. It will be a discouragement to <hi>Informers,</hi> if the Goods must <hi>ex debito Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticiae</hi> be delivered to the Owner.</p>

                  <hi>Serjeant Maynard contr'.</hi> These Writs cannot be grantable <hi>ex gratia</hi> or <hi>favore Curiae,</hi> for the Court can do nothing out of <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Favour. Ex gratia Principis</hi> they may be grantable, but then the <hi>Court</hi> must have a <hi>Privy Seal.</hi> They are gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>ex debito Justiciae,</hi> but in what Cases, rests in the legal Discretion of the Court; nor can there be any great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience one way or other in the Goods remaining, or not, in the custody of the Seizor; for the <hi>Informer</hi> may prosecute faintly without delivery of the Goods as well as after delivery, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be an <hi>Informer</hi> set up on purpose. And the Case of a <hi>Replevin</hi> of Goods taken by the <hi>Kings</hi> Officer may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputable notwithstanding the Book of <hi>3 H. 7. 1.</hi> And the Case of <hi>Felons Goods</hi> is stronger, and that is Common Law, and by the same reason this should be Common Law too; and so concluded for the <hi>Claimers.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>By Mr. <hi>Atkins,</hi> That as the Case is, the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> must perform her part of the Agreement first, otherwise the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> cannot convey to the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> 50 <hi>l. per annum</hi> out of the said Estate.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Stephens pro Defendente,</hi> That he may; for it was not the intent of the <hi>Act</hi> to exclude them, but Strangers that were not of the Company; and the Act is an Act of Confirmation, rather than of Creation; Besides, 1. there is no inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in such Persons trading; and the Act was made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress an Inconvenience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When a particular Benefit is intended, it does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to other Persons.</p>

               <p>A 4th Reason he grounded upon a <hi>Proviso</hi> in the Act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>Hull;</hi> and cited 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> Doctor <hi>Bonhams Case.</hi> That the Priviledges granted to the College of Physitians extended to Graduates without nomination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Atkins,</hi> for the <hi>Attorny General.</hi> The Act 1st. alters the Name of the Corporation. 2. It alters the Penalty. 3. It makes an alteration in the Traders, <hi>viz.</hi> That none shall Trade thither, <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Denizen,</hi> without Licence, which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52142:61"/> extends to particular Persons even of the Company, to restrain their Trading thither without Licence.

               <p>And the <hi>Court</hi> inclined to be of this Opinion, for the great Inconvenience was the single and separate Trade of those of the Company, and not of <hi>Foreigners,</hi> who could not Trade without leave of the Company.

               <p>The 2d <hi>Reason</hi> I go upon is, to avoid <hi>circuity of Action;</hi> for <hi>frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora,</hi> 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 23, 24. <hi>John Pursoe's Case.</hi> If a Man make a Lease for years and <hi>covenant</hi> that the Lessee may cut down Trées; the Lessee may plead this in an Action of <hi>Waste,</hi> without being put to an Action of <hi>Covenant.</hi> So in <hi>Debt</hi> upon an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation the <hi>Defendant</hi> may plead that after the sealing of the Bond the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> granted to him that he should not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded till such a time, and if he were that he might plead it in discharge; this is a good Plea in <hi>Bar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that it appears by these Cases that the Law will not work the dissolution of any thing, but in case of necessity; nor will countenance <hi>circuity of Actions,</hi> and perplexity of Suits, if it may be avoided.</p>

And therefore if a Writ of <hi>Mordancester</hi> be brought agains two <hi>Joyntenants,</hi> and one of them die, the Writ <hi>abates</hi> only against him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the whole Estate of the Land survives to the other; and there is no <hi>alteration</hi> made.

               <p>And as the Law is so in real Actions, which are more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, and must have proper Tenants; so it is the same in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Actions, and upon the same reason.</p>

               <p>A second diversity there is betwixt the Act of <hi>God</hi> or of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the Act of the <hi>Party:</hi> For if the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> pending the Suit, will release to one of the <hi>Defendants,</hi> it will <hi>abate</hi> the <hi>Writ</hi> against them all; otherwise, in case of death.</p>

               <p>In answer to the Reasons alledged by the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> to the contrary, he said; 1. That nothing tryable at Law was touched here. 2.

               <p>THE Case was, That Sir <hi>James Bagg</hi> Father of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(6)"/> George,</hi> being an <hi>Accountant</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> as Receiver of his Customs in 2 <hi>Car.</hi> In 3 <hi>Car.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52142:70"/> and sold to the <hi>Defendant George</hi> and his Heirs, being then of the Age of <hi>nine</hi> years, <hi>the</hi> Mannor of <hi>Leigham</hi> for 1200 <hi>l.</hi> paid by Sir <hi>James Bagg,</hi> who afterwards received the Profits during his Life, and dyed in <hi>Aug.</hi> the 14th of <hi>King Charles,</hi> being endebted to the <hi>King</hi> in the sum of 22500 <hi>l.</hi> for the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms by him received in 12 <hi>Car.</hi> After his death a Writ of <hi>Diem clausit extremum</hi> issued bearing date the last day of the preceding <hi>Trin. Term</hi> to enquire what Lands he had when he became indebted to the <hi>King,</hi> upon which it was found that he was then <hi>inter alia</hi> seized of this Mannor, and the Lands were seized into the <hi>King's</hi> Hands. Afterwards in <hi>Hill. Term</hi> 1649. the <hi>Defendant George Bag</hi> pleaded as Ter-te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Extent, the said Conveyance in 3 <hi>Car.</hi> And the <hi>Attorny General</hi> upon consideration of the said Conveyance entred a <hi>Nolle ulterius prosequi;</hi> whereupon Iudgment was given, that <hi>the Hands of the Keepers of the Liberties, &amp;c.</hi> should be <hi>amoved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards the <hi>Defendant George</hi> compounded for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, being forfeited for <hi>Delinquency;</hi> and another person, who had paid the Composition Mony, had it mortgaged to him for his Security before the <hi>Information</hi> exhibited. And the <hi>Court</hi> was of opinion that this was <hi>Fraud apparent;</hi> and sufficient matter disclosed, to satisfie them, that this Mannor was the Estate of Sir <hi>Ja. Bagg,</hi> being purchased with his Mony, and the Profits received by him during his Life. And they would not try the fraud. They were also of opinion that the Extent was well executed, though the Writ bore <hi>Teste</hi> before Sir <hi>James's</hi> death; and it was a good Warrant to make enquiry after his death, under the Hands of the <hi>Treasurer</hi> and <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and according to the common course of such Writs, which never bear <hi>Teste</hi> in the <hi>Vacation</hi> time, but from Term to Term. But they doubted whether this Iudgment, as it is entred without a <hi>Salvo Jure</hi> should bind or no, the <hi>Amoveas manum</hi> being absolute: But they all held that the <hi>Statute</hi> of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 23. does not extend to this Case of a <hi>Nolle prosequi. Et adjornatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Mich. Term</hi> the matter was argued, and the Question was whether or no after such Iudgment as aforesaid, the <hi>Protector</hi> could bring in question again the validity of that Conveyance for Fraud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hardres.</hi> I conceive he cannot. 1.

Matters <hi>de hors,</hi> as the <hi>Death</hi> of a Party, or the Iudgment of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners</hi> in an Outlawry; do not concern the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> it self, and they may therefore be drawn in question, but not a matter once questioned and adjudged, 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
               <p>If upon an <hi>Information</hi> in this <hi>Court</hi> for <hi>Prisage</hi> it appear upon the <hi>Defendant's</hi> Plea that there was not a sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Wines, and Iudgment is given accordingly upon the <hi>Attorney-General's</hi> Confession, this matter can never be drawn in question again upon an <hi>English Information</hi> upon Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Fraud; and it is the usual course in such Cases to prefer a Bill before Iudgment to examin the Fraud, which shews that after Iudgment there is no remedy: So here.</p>
               <p>My 2d Reason is, because by the Iudgment <hi>transit in rem judicatam,</hi> 6 <hi>Rep.</hi> 44. <hi>b.

And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son there given is because else Actions and Iudgments upon one and the same cause of Action would be infinite, to the perpetual Vexation and Charge of the Subject, which the Law avoids. <hi>Interest Reipublicae ut sit finis litium.</hi>

If a Deed be enrolled, or Iudgment given against the <hi>Defendant</hi> upon a Release pleaded, he shall never afterwards be admitted to say that it is not his Déed, or that it is a good Release; for this would be to impeach the point tryed: But in a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral point he may, as to say that he had nothing in the Lands at the time of the Release.</p>

               <p n="4">4thly.

If a Man enter into <hi>Warranty</hi> of Lands, this extends to a Rent issuing out of the Land; but if he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Warranty saving his Rent, all's well.</p>
               <p>The want of a <hi>Saving</hi> has always used to the conclude the <hi>King,</hi> not so as to debar him of any other Title, but to conclude him in the Title tryed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The <hi>Protector</hi> at this rate will be in a worse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than a common person; for he cannot have a Writ of <hi>Error.</hi>

                  <hi>Resp.</hi> No he is not; for a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> lies for the one as well as the other upon an erroneous Iudgment; and this is common Experience; but in this Case there is no reason why he should be in a better condition, because it tends to the disquiet of the Subject.</p>

                  <hi>Allen pro Quer'.</hi> The breach is well assigned, and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance appears upon the Record; and the manner of it to be with-holding the possession, which can be by none but the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants</hi> themselves or their Testators: He cited <hi>Smiths Case, 17 Ed. 4. 2. 1 Cro.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hardres.</hi> Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> seems to admit, that if it shall not be intended by the <hi>Court</hi> that there is a sufficient <hi>Breach</hi> laid in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> that then it is naught: For this; It must be considered what the <hi>Covenant</hi> is, and how the <hi>Breach</hi> is laid: The <hi>Covenant</hi> is, <hi>That it shall and may be lawful for the said Sir</hi> Iames Lewis, <hi>his Executors and Assigns, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any thing heretofore done by the said</hi> Thomas <hi>and</hi> Henry Dockwray <hi>to the contrary, to take into their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the extended Lands therein mentioned, and to hold and enjoy, and take the Profits thereof during all the time the same should remain in the possession of the said</hi> Henry Dock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray, <hi>his Executors, Administrators or Assigns, by vertue or reason of the said Extent, without any let, suit, trouble, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance or demand of the said</hi> Henry <hi>or</hi> Thomas Dockwray, <hi>their Executors, Administrators or Assigns, or of either of them;</hi> the breach is laid, <hi>That the</hi> Plaintiff <hi>could not take into his possession all the said Premises, and hold and enjoy and take the profits thereof during the said time, by reason of the let, trouble, disturbance and demand of the said</hi> Henry <hi>and</hi> Thomas, <hi>and of the Administrators of the said, &amp;c. against the form of the said Indenture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The <hi>Breach</hi> as it is laid is apparent, for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> declares <hi>that he could not take into his possession, &amp;c.</hi> which strongly implies, that the possession was with-held from him by them, which is a <hi>sufficient Breach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> That is not necessarily implied in these words, for the <hi>Breach</hi> is laid in one entire and continued Clause, and not by parcels, and so it must be taken altogether; and if by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment</hi> it may be taken one way or other, the strongest shall be taken against the <hi>Countor;</hi> and in truth, in this Case, as appears by <hi>Affidavit,</hi> the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> and they that claimed under him, enjoyed the Lands many years, and paid Rent for them: Now taking the Sentence altogether, it will appear incongruous to say that it shall be presumed here, that the possession was with-held, and to say that the <hi>possession</hi> was <hi>with-held</hi> by reason of a <hi>disturbance</hi> or <hi>demand,</hi> and that is not proper in <hi>Common Parlance;</hi> for none can be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed</hi> who is out of possession, nor can a Man be kept out of possession by a <hi>demand;</hi> so that the with-holding of the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52142:74"/> as here laid, may or may not be: I admit that when a <hi>Declaration</hi> has such a sufficient certainty, that by necessary intendment it cannot be taken otherwise, it is well enough; as in <hi>14 Eliz. Dyer 304.</hi> A Lease made by a Parson, <hi>virtute cujus</hi> he was possessed; the <hi>Life of the Parson</hi> needs not be <hi>averted;</hi> for it is necessarily implied; so <hi>14 Eliz. Dyer 306. b. Trover</hi> and <hi>Conversion</hi> of a <hi>Hawk,</hi> and declares that he was possest of it, <hi>ut de bonis suis propriis;</hi> he needs not alledge that it was <hi>reclaimed,</hi> for that is necessarily implied in the words, that he was possest of it, <hi>ut de bonis suis propriis;</hi> so <hi>10 Rep.</hi> in the Bishop of <hi>Sarums Case;</hi> In <hi>Avowry</hi> for Rent reserved upon a <hi>Bishops</hi> Lease, which was voidable, the Party does not aver that the <hi>Bishop</hi> was dead, and if not, the Lease held good during his Life; but because in the Declaration he was called <hi>nuper Episcopus,</hi> it was held good, <hi>causa qua supra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the words of a <hi>Declaration</hi> may have two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments, they shall be taken most strongly against the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff,</hi> for they must shew fully and precisely wherein the Party is agrieved; and that they do not, when they stand indifferently whether the <hi>Defendant</hi> be a <hi>Tort-feasor</hi> or not; for since the Declaration is what the <hi>Defendant</hi> is compellable to answer to, and lays the Foundation of what the <hi>Court</hi> is to give their Iudgment upon; it is but reason that it should be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; <hi>1.</hi> That the <hi>Defendant</hi> may know what to answer to, and the <hi>Court</hi> whereupon to adjudge; and therefore if there be two Intendments, of which one makes for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and the other against him; that which makes against him shall be taken, and if the truth be of his side, it is his folly not to disclose it, <hi>vide Plow. Com. 202. Stradling</hi> and <hi>Morgans Case</hi> adjudged upon this ground. In <hi>Debt</hi> upon <hi>7 Ed. 6.</hi> against a Receiver of the <hi>Kings</hi> Revenue. In <hi>Waste,</hi> If a Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the Reversion was granted to him, and the Tenant attorned and had done <hi>Waste;</hi> it is not good, unless it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the Waste was done after <hi>Attornment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3 Ed. 4. 21.</hi> In Debt against a Successor of a Prior for a Sallary; the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> declared that he was retained with the <hi>Defendants</hi> Predecessor as his Baily in Husbandry, and that his Services came to the use of the House, but did not alledge expresly that he was retained by the Predecessor, and it may be that he was retained by some other Person, who had no power to retain him; therefore the <hi>Count</hi> was held to be ill. <hi>Hill. 11 Car. R. in Error</hi> by the Lady <hi>Throgmorton</hi> against <hi>Rich. Windwood</hi> upon a Iudgment given in an Action of <hi>Waste,</hi> the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had declared upon a Bargain and Sale
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52142:75"/> made to him of the Reversion, in <hi>14 Jac. 1.</hi> and enrolled within <hi>six</hi> Months, and also upon a Fine levied to him within the <hi>six</hi> Months, and that he was seized by vertue of the Bargain and Sale; and Exception was taken because the <hi>Declaration</hi> does not expresly lay the Fine to have passed after the Enrolment; for if before, then the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> was in by the Fine; but says generally that the Enrolment was within <hi>six</hi> Months; and that within those <hi>six</hi> Months the Fine passed. And by all the <hi>Justices</hi> against <hi>Jones</hi> it was held Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; because <hi>Declarations</hi> must be <hi>certain</hi> in every point, and where they may be taken two ways, the strongest shall be taken against the <hi>Plaintiff, Hill. 13 Car. B. R. Marshal <hi>versus</hi> Hall in Error</hi> of a Iudgment in <hi>C. B.</hi> in an <hi>Assumpsit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Case it may be the possession was with held from the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> by <hi>Dockwray,</hi> and it may be it was not; for it is not expresly alleged; and therefore it shall be taken most strongly against the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and the <hi>Declaration</hi> is not good.</p>

               <p>THE Defendant was charged by <hi>English Bill,</hi> for that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(1)"/> being a Merchant, in the year <hi>1657.</hi> did conceal the <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Excise</hi> of <hi>290</hi> Casks of <hi>Currants</hi> imported at the Port of <hi>London,</hi> in a Ship called the <hi>Christopher of London;</hi> and for that he endeavoured to corrupt <hi>Nathaniel Hawes</hi> and <hi>John Oldenham,</hi> two of the Officers for the <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,</hi> and promise them a Reward of <hi>40 l.</hi> a piece for their Connivance therein, that thereby he might take away the said Goods without paying the <hi>due Custom</hi> and <hi>Excise</hi> for the same; and that he did accordingly pay to the said two Officers <hi>40 l.</hi> a piece; therefore for relief and discovery of the Truth, was the Scope of the Bill; to which the Defendant demurred, for that the Bill and the Charge thereof concerns matter of <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor;</hi> for which, if guilty thereof, the Party may incur great Penalties and Forfeitures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serjeant Archer pro Defendente.</hi> The Defendant is not compellable to answer to this Bill; for that it is against Law and Reason to oblige any Man to accuse himself; And it has been often resolved in this Court, that in a Suit for Tithes, unless the Plaintiff demand the single value only; the Defendant shall not be compelled to answer so as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scover the quantity and nature of Predial Tithes; and so it was adjudged in this Court, <hi>1 Jac.</hi> in <hi>Fenner</hi> and <hi>Robinsons Case.</hi>

                  <hi>Atkins pro Quer'.</hi> This Bill is according to the common Course, and pursuant to Presidents in Court; and the rather ought the Defendant here to answer, because no Penalty or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture is demanded by the Bill; but a discovery and no more: It is usual to prefer a Bill against Merchants, to discover the quantity of Wines imported in such or such a Ship, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Prisage</hi> is an ancient Duty and Revenue of the Crown, <hi>Trin. 29 Eliz.

               <p>
                  <hi>Stephens pro Quer'.</hi> He cited the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>33 H. 8. cap. 39.</hi> which gives Power and Authority to this Court, to hear and determine such Offences as they conceive to be meet, <hi>Vide Statutum;</hi> and in <hi>10 Car.</hi> in <hi>Blackford</hi> and <hi>Guyers Case,</hi> in this Court, <hi>Lib. decret. fol. 185.</hi> this very Point was over-ruled upon a Demurrer, and the Defendant put to answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shaftoe pro Defendente.</hi> He cited a President in <hi>11 Car.</hi> in one <hi>Huntleys Case,</hi> That in a Bill against one <hi>Ralph Bowes</hi> for importing Cards without Licence, the Defendant should not be forced to answer, because he might thereby be drawn within the Penalty of a Statute; and <hi>Co.

Vpon this ground, though the Parties own Confession of a Crime be the clearest Proof in the Law, yet if such Confession proceed from Dread, or be extorted by any Compulsion, it ought not to be received against him;

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52142:77"/> This Conclusion will naturally follow, that if neither <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, Customary Law</hi> nor <hi>Statute Law</hi> do compel the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to answer in this Case, then he ought not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to it. Now the <hi>Common Law,</hi> as appears in <hi>Doct.</hi> and <hi>Stud. cap. 1.</hi> is what hath been used and accustomed time out of mind, and has passed for Law; and <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is said to have been made but in <hi>affirmance</hi> of the <hi>Common Law,</hi> which was in being long before that Statute was made; and therefore if the Defendant were by the <hi>Common Law</hi> obliged to answer, as in this Case; it must appear that the ancient and constant Practice has been so; but that does not appear; so that the <hi>Common Law</hi> does not warrant it.</p>
               <p>Nor is it by <hi>Statute Law,</hi> for there is no such <hi>Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Customary Law</hi> is twofold, <hi>Consuetudo Patriae &amp; Curiae. Consuetudo Patriae</hi> is what is used throughout a Country; as <hi>Gavel-kind</hi> and <hi>Borough-English,</hi> and therefore it is called <hi>Lex. Patriae. Consuetudo Curiae</hi> is the Custom and Practice of a <hi>Court;</hi> and this must be supported by constant Vse and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and not by two or three Presidents: but where the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are judicial, the Iudges must have given Iudgment accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly by divers Successions of Ages; as appears <hi>4 Rep. Rawlins Case 54. a. Commonalty of Sadlers Case 57. a. and Slades Case 94. a.</hi> Therefore if in this Case there has not been a Succession of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Presidents for some Ages; then is there no such Law of this Court; and there has been no such Succession here, for there has really but one been found; <hi>ergo,</hi> since neither <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law,</hi> nor <hi>Customary Law,</hi> nor <hi>Statute Law</hi> compels the Defendant in this Case to answer, he ought not to be compelled.</p>
               <p>Besides, it appears <hi>Co. Mag. Chart. p. 50.</hi> That by vertue of these words <hi>per Legem Terrae,</hi> none ought to be drawn to answer to any Offence, but by Indictment or Presentment; then if this course of proceeding hath not a Foundation in <hi>Law,</hi> as it appears by these Rules and Statutes that it has not; then there is in this Cause good reason for a <hi>Demurrer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> wherein Men were compell'd to answer to criminal matters without Indictment or Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that Court was establsshed by Act of Parliament, <hi>viz. 3 Hen. 7.</hi> and yet the Course that afterwards crept up there, to examin Men upon Interrogatories upon Oath, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Bane of that Court, and has béen adjudged ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal by the late Act of Parliament, that took away the Court and all other like Iurisdictions, <hi>17 Car. 1. cap. 10.</hi> and that because they were contrary to <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> And yet in that very Court, if any appeared to be of dangerous Consequence to the Procéedings at <hi>Common Law,</hi> and not cognisable in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52142:78"/> the Court of <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> it would not be admitted in such Cases to interrogate Men upon their Oaths. And therefore in Sir <hi>Steven Proctor's Case <hi>versus</hi> Darnbrock</hi> and others, <hi>Hobart's Rep. 138.</hi> Vpon a Bill there for divers, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for one horrible Ryot, because it appeared upon the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that one <hi>Wetheral,</hi> who had beén grievously hurt in the Ryot, died within threé Months after; the Bill was dismiss'd upon advice with the Iudges; because it exceéded the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Court, and was of dangerous Consequence, though it were laid but a Ryot in the Bill. In the same Book, <hi>p. 195. Tufton</hi> and <hi>Nevil's Case,</hi> there was a Bill preferred in the Court of <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for a Ryot, and it was laid by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement, that the Defendant had solicited the Plaintiffs Wife to Vnchastity; as to that part the Defendant <hi>demurr'd,</hi> and ruled to be a good cause of <hi>Demurrer;</hi> though laid but by way of <hi>Inducement;</hi> and the reason there given, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Crime of Vnchastity was naturally <hi>alieni fori, viz.</hi> for the <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> whose Procéeding was not to be usurped upon nor prevented. The like reason holds in our Case; for the Offences and Crimes laid in the Bill do properly belong to the <hi>Common-Law,</hi> and are punishable by the <hi>Common Law</hi> by way of <hi>Information</hi> or <hi>Indictment;</hi> and therefore ought not to be questioned here; especially since they are laid directly and are the main scope of the Bill, and are not laid by way of <hi>Inducement,</hi> as in the other Case.</p>
               <p>Now if neither <hi>Common-Law, Statute-Law,</hi> nor <hi>Custom</hi> (which ought to have the Requisites aforesaid) can be shewn; as no such hath yet been shewn, nor (I believe) can be; then there is no ground for this Bill, but being contrary to all these Laws, it must be naught.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> Head that I insist upon is, <hi>Reason. 1.</hi> It is against the common practice of all Courts of Iustice to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force Men to answer in such Cases. For it cannot be shewn that there was ever a Bill exhibited against a <hi>Popish Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi> to compel him to answer, whether he were a <hi>Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusant</hi> or not, whereby he would forfeit two parts of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state in Lands, and all his Goods: nor upon the late Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament against <hi>Delinquents,</hi> was it conceived reasonable to compel a Man to answer; whether he were a <hi>Delinquent,</hi> or whether he had done any Act that would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him so; <hi>causa qua supra;</hi> although neither <hi>Popish Recusant</hi> nor <hi>Delinquents,</hi> are liable to any Iudgment of Life or Member.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> There is no President of any such Practice for <hi>20</hi> years and upwards last past; and <hi>disuser</hi> renders a thing absolute, <hi>vide Lit.</hi> upon the Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> That an Action lies not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52142:78"/> against a Lord for disparagement of his Ward, because it had been disused; so here.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> My <hi>third</hi> Reason is <hi>ab incongrou.</hi> It is a very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous way of proceeding; for by this means the ordinary way of proceeding by <hi>Information</hi> and <hi>Indictment</hi> would be interrupted; and the Rule is, <hi>Non est decurrendum ad extra-ordinarium, vbi valet ordinarium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> If this were allowed, what need would there be of Officers and Searchers to look after such things? The Laws which appoint such Officers, do implicitly acknowledge, that Men are not obliged to confess.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5.</hi> Because the matter charged throughout the Bill, is a direct <hi>Crime, viz.</hi> substracting Customs and Excise, and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery in order thereunto, which is of greater concernment then the substracting of Tithes, which yet it has been often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled that a Man shall not answer to by Bill, when a <hi>penalty</hi> is required; but in this Case there is a <hi>penalty</hi> and a <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> besides in another Degree, and in another Court.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6.</hi> That that is contrary to a <hi>Maxim</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> must not be admitted in a course of proceeding in Equity; and upon this Reason it is adjudged in <hi>Beverleys Case, 4 Rep.</hi> That because it is against a Rule of Law, that any Man should be admitted to <hi>stultifie</hi> himself; as to say, that he was <hi>non compos mentis;</hi> that therefore no Relief lay in Equity in such Case, because if that were admitted, a <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Common Law</hi> would be thereby subverted; so here. And for these Reasons I conceive there is here good cause of <hi>Demurrer.</hi>

               <p>My third Ground is <hi>Authorities, vide 1 and 2 Eliz. Dyer 175. Scrogs <hi>versus</hi> Coleshil. Scrogs</hi> was put into an <hi>Exigencers</hi> place by the <hi>Chief Justice;</hi> and <hi>Coleshil</hi> had a Prior Grant of the same Office from the <hi>Queen temp. Vacationis</hi> of the Office of <hi>Chief Justice.</hi> A contest arising betwixt these two, the Queen directed a Commission to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Bedford</hi> and nine others to hear and determine the Interest and Title to the Office between the Parties; and if <hi>Scrogs</hi> should refuse to make answer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then to commit him to Prison; <hi>Scrogs</hi> did refuse to answer before the <hi>Queens</hi> Commissioners; and being committed by them, pray'd his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and the Court granted it; and in 18 <hi>Eliz. Hindes Case.</hi> when one refused to answer to Interrogatories before Commissioners concerning <hi>Usury, Habeas Corpus</hi> granted <hi>per Cur'.</hi>

                  <hi>10 Eliz. Dyer,</hi> but <hi>not printed;</hi> there is a Case of one <hi>Leigh,</hi> an Attorny of the Court of Common Pleas, who was committed to prison, because he refused to answer before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, whether he had been at Mass, or no?

               </p>
               <p>In <hi>4 Jac.</hi> A Case upon the <hi>Oath ex Officio</hi> was referred in Parliament time to the two <hi>Chief Justices, Popham</hi> and <hi>Coke;</hi> and it was held by them, that no Ecclesiastical Person could be examined upon Oath for a Matter punishable at <hi>Common Law,</hi> as <hi>Usury, &amp;c.</hi> for that if he were, his Answer would be Evidence against him.</p>
               <p>The Statute of <hi>2 H. 4. cap. 15.</hi> which impowred the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to procéed according to the Canons of the Church, is repealed by <hi>25 H. 8. cap. 14.</hi> by which Act it is declared not to be consonant to Iustice or Equity, that any Man should be convicted, or incur any Loss in his Fame or Goods, but by Accusation and Witnesses, Presentment, Verdict, Confession or Outlawry; and it says moreover, that the most expert and diligent Man in the World cannot escape the incurring some Penalty and Danger; if he be liable to be examined upon such captious Interrogatories as may be administred to him; so here: Besides these Authorities, I have three Presidents in this Court.</p>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52142:79"/> by Information; and therefore the Parties need not be sued in <hi>equity</hi> to compel them to condemn themselves.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>4th</hi> place I proposed to answer some <hi>Objections</hi> that have been made.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. Obj.</hi> This Court ought to preserve the <hi>Revenues of the Crown,</hi> and to prevent Frauds and Deceits therein, which cannot be done effectually without enforcing a Discovery thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The same Objection may be made in Case of any <hi>Offence</hi> whatsoever; for the punishment of Offences is <hi>pro bono publico,</hi> and before they are punished they must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected; and the <hi>Revenue</hi> is concerned there too in point of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures;</hi> and yet Men are not put in such Cases to answer <hi>upon Oath</hi> to convict themselves. The difference is betweén Causes <hi>Criminal</hi> and <hi>Civil;</hi> If an Offender be once legally convicted of an Offence, whereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he ought to forfeit his Estate, then it is lawful and proper to prefer a Bill to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what Estate in Lands and Goods he then had, as in Case of an <hi>Outlawry</hi> or <hi>Attainder, &amp;c.</hi> for the effect of such a Bill is only to discover what is forfeited already, and not to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a cause of Forfeiture, as in this Case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again.</hi> The Publick <hi>Revenues</hi> ought to be collected and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured according to <hi>Law,</hi> and not by any means or method contrary thereunto: The <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> cannot, nor ought to prejudice the Subject.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. Obj.</hi> It is common to prefer a Bill for <hi>Prisage</hi> of Wines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp. Prisage</hi> is an Ancient Revenue of the Crown; Sir <hi>John Davis 8. b. 10. a.</hi> And may be claimed by <hi>Charter,</hi> as in <hi>London;</hi> or by <hi>Prescription,</hi> as by the Bishop of <hi>Durham, Vid. 6 Ed. 3. 189. b. &amp; Quo Warranto 113.</hi> nor is there a <hi>Penalty</hi> in the Case; so that such a Bill is no more than a Bill to discover a Duty in which the Crown has an Inheritance.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3. Obj.</hi> It was usual to prefer Bills in the <hi>Court of Wards</hi> to discover <hi>Tenures in Capite,</hi> which was penal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> Those <hi>Tenures,</hi> and the Incidents thereunto, as <hi>mean Rates, &amp;c.</hi> cannot properly be termed <hi>penal,</hi> for they were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the ancient Common Law of the Realm; and were no other than Reservations betwixt Lords and Tenants upon the distribution of Lands, and the original Creation of <hi>Tenures;</hi> and yet even the course of Discovery was accounted a Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and was one Cause amongst many, why those <hi>Tenures</hi> were put down.</p>

                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:52142:80"/>
                  <hi>4. Obj.</hi> The scope of this Bill is only to have a <hi>discovery,</hi> and not to inflict any <hi>punishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> Though the Bill does not tend directly to inflict a punishment, yet it makes way to inflict one; and the Lord <hi>Coke Mag. Chart. p. 48.</hi> observes, that all oblique Proceedings, contrary to Law, are a kind of <hi>destruction,</hi> and a breach of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> and the Rule there is, <hi>Quando aliquid prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur, prohibetur omne id per quod devenitur ad illud;</hi> so that if this Bill be a means to render the Defendant liable to punishment elsewhere, it is all one as if he were liable to be punished here, and upon this very Prosecution; and the words <hi>(no ways destroyed)</hi> are very remarkable; for they extend to all means whatsoever tending to <hi>destruction.</hi>

                  <hi>JOHN Mills</hi> being seized in Fée of divers Lands and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements in <hi>Hoathfield</hi> in <hi>Kent 7 Apr. 1587.</hi> devised them to his Son <hi>George</hi> to have and to hold him and his Heirs in Fee-simple for ever. And if it should happen the said <hi>George</hi> to die before he should come to the age of <hi>21</hi> years, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Heirs of his Body lawfully begotten, that then the said Lands should wholly remain to his Son <hi>Samuel</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>prout, &amp;c.</hi> and so to his other Children in like manner; and afterwards to <hi>Jo. T.</hi> and his Heirs, and after dyed. <hi>George</hi> the Son entred and married the Plaintiff; and by his Will dated the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>May, 1641.</hi> devised the said Premises to his thrée Daughters equally betwéen them; and devised an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of <hi>5. l. per annum</hi> out of the same to his Wife, for her Life, and dyed; the Defendant's Father purchased two of the Daughters shares in the Premises, and never paid any part of the said Annuity.</p>
               <p>The Question was, whether or no, as this Case is, the Devisor could charge the said Lands with the Annuity or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hardres pro Quer.</hi> I conceive the Devisor had power to charge the Estate with this <hi>Annuity.</hi> The Question will be, what Estate <hi>George</hi> takes by his Father Will; <hi>viz.</hi> whether an Estate in <hi>Fee-simple</hi> or in <hi>Fee-tail:</hi> And I hold, that he hath a <hi>Fee-simple</hi> Estate. <hi>1.</hi> Because the first words in the Will give him an absolute Fée-simple; and the subsequent words <hi>(And if, &amp;c.)</hi> are not words of <hi>Limitation</hi> or <hi>Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> but of <hi>Collateral determination.</hi> And that they are so appears by this, <hi>viz.</hi> Because <hi>George's</hi> Estate is made determinable upon his dying <hi>within Age</hi> and <hi>without Issue,</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:52142:81"/> both must happen, or else his Estate continues. Also the Determination is limited to a certain time; and therefore is not a Limitation of the Estate. As if Lands were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to a Man and his Heirs so long as such a Trée shall grow or such a House stand; the Devisée would have a Fée-simple, but qualified with a Collateral Determination, <hi>Vid. Plo. Com. Walsingham's Case.</hi> And this is not like to <hi>Sonday's Case 9 Rep.</hi> A Devise to one and his Heirs, and if he dye without Heirs of his Body, that then the Land shall remain to another; for there the subsequent words shew what Heirs were meant by the preceeding words, as in <hi>Baldwin's Case 2 Rep.</hi> A Grant to one and <hi>his Heirs, Habendum</hi> to him and <hi>the Heirs of his Body;</hi> but here it is, <hi>If he dye within Age and without Issue, then, &amp;c.</hi> so that the words <hi>(without Heirs of his Body)</hi> are not put in by way of <hi>Limitation</hi> of the Estate, but are joyned and coupled with other words, which are not words of <hi>Limitation,</hi> but of <hi>Determination.</hi> And admitting, as it really happened in this Case, that <hi>George</hi> should attain the age of <hi>21 years,</hi> if yet his Estate should be held to determin by his dying <hi>without Issue,</hi> that would be directly contrary to the very words of the Devisor, and to his meaning and intention, which must be gathered from his words: The words are, that his Estate shall not determin unless he dye <hi>within Age</hi> and <hi>without Issue; &amp; mala est ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positio quae corrumpit viscera textus.</hi> But the better Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that which makes all the words stand and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent.</p>

                  <hi>Object. 16 Eliz. Dyer 330. b. Clache's Case,</hi> There the Case was, that Lands were devised to one Daughter and to her Heirs; and if she happened to die within the age of <hi>six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years,</hi> living her Sister, then to her Sister and her Heirs; and if the second Daughter dyed without Issue, then to the third Daughter and to her Heirs; and if both the Daughters died without Issue, then to a Son and his Heirs; and if they all died without Issue, then to a Stranger in Fee. There it was held by <hi>Dyer,</hi> that none of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had any <hi>Estate-tail,</hi> but a <hi>Fee-simple Estate: Sed alii e contra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> That Case does not oppose what I argue for in this. For it is not there held that none of those Limitations make a <hi>Fee-simple</hi> Estate. But the opinion of <hi>Dyer,</hi> that <hi>none</hi> of the Limitations there made a <hi>Fee-simple,</hi> is opposed; for all the Limitations there are not alike; some of them having these words only to limit or determin them, <hi>viz. If she dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Issue.</hi>

               <p>For Authorities. <hi>Mich. 2 Jac. Com. B. Emerson's Case.</hi> A Man devised Land to his four Sons in Fee, and if one of them dyed without Issue, that his part should survive. In that Case it was held, that if three of them dyed without Issue, the fourth had a <hi>Fee-simple,</hi> because the subsequent words were not added by way of <hi>Limitation,</hi> but of <hi>Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                  <hi>2. 17 Jac.

And it was held <hi>per Cur.</hi> that the first Son took a <hi>Fee-sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> by the Will. But the great Question was, whether a Remainder could be limited upon it or not; because a Remainder in Fée cannot be limited upon a Fee. But it was held that the Remainder was good, because it did not depend upon a <hi>Limitation,</hi> but a <hi>Collateral determination</hi> of the Estate. For that the words, <hi>if he dye without Issue,</hi> were not absolute and indefinite, but tyed up to a Contingency, <hi>viz. living William.</hi>

                  <hi>3. Hill. 1650. Banc. R. Hanbury <hi>versus</hi> Cockman,</hi> upon a special Verdict. A Man devised to his Son and his Heirs certain Lands with a <hi>Proviso,</hi> that if he died before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage or before his age of <hi>21</hi> years without Issue, then the Lands should remain to his second Son in Fee: The eldest Son attained his age of <hi>21</hi> years, and then died without Issue. The <hi>Court</hi> adjudged in that Case upon the first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that this was a contingent Remainder, and that it could not take effect, because the Contingency never happened, as it must do, before that Remainder could come in being. And there it was said, that when the words are clear and plain in themselves, the Court ought not to make a doubtful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction upon them, and that all the Preliminaries must happen before the Remainder takes Effect. So in this Case of ours the Defendant <hi>George</hi> must dye within Age, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Issue, before the Contingency can take effect; which it is impossible that he should do when he has attained his full age; and by consequence he had, when he came of age, an absolute Estate in <hi>Fee-simple;</hi> and his Devise of the Annuity good in Law. <hi>Vid.</hi> for farther Authorities, <hi>2. &amp; 3 Ph. &amp; Mar.

                  <hi>Allen &amp; Stevens pro Defendente.</hi> Admitting the Plea to be naught, yet the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ought not to demur to it. But the Court ought to have beén moved in it, and upon view of the Letters Patents to have determined the matter. And by the Demurrer he has confesse the Plea. But to that the Court answered that a Demurrer was no Confession of any thing not sufficiently pleaded.

Because it is not averred that the Patent or the Inrolment of it was shewn to the Sheriff, as the Patent directs. And it is not sufficient to say, that he had Notice of it; for that is not traversable as it is here pleaded, being laid too generally; and because it is not expressed by whom he had Notice, so that a certain Issue might be taken upon it.</p>

               <p>And the <hi>Court</hi> was of this Opinion, because it came too near a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> and restrained <hi>Trade,</hi> and because no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident was shewn in Point.

               <p>THE Case upon <hi>English Bill</hi> was thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Articles of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(4)"/> Agréement were made betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and Sir <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Vermuyden</hi> and others, for the draining of <hi>Hatfield</hi> level lying in <hi>Lincolnshire, Yorkshire &amp; alibi;</hi> by which Agréement the <hi>King</hi> was to have one part of the Lands to be drained, the Drainers another part, and the Tenants and Commoners a third part; and that the Drainers in consideration of their being allowed their third part should make Enclosures and maintain them in all times to come. Afterwards the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff,</hi> who was no party to the Articles, was assest by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of Sewers for Lands that he had in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> towards the Maintenance of a certain Sewer; against which he seeks Relief, and to have all those who have Lands charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able towards the maintaining of it, contribute. Vpon the hearing it was objected that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> was not party nor privy to the Articles, nor claimed under any that were. But it was answered, that he had good cause of Suit for all that, and to crave Relief by the Equity of the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>of Sewers,</hi> and according to the proportion there mentioned; because he is aggrieved by this Assessment through their not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Banks, who are obliged to repair them by these Articles. And whatever the Commissioners of Sewers may do, this Court may; that is, the Court may lay the Charge upon them, who have bound themselves by Articles, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all such as are endamaged by this Drain and Assessment; and a Case in <hi>Chancery</hi> was cited betwixt the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> and <hi>Wainwright;</hi> the Earl was decreéd to admit Copy-holders at a Fine certain, which he refused to do; and thereupon Copy-holders were relieved, who were no parties to the Decreé.

And being made <hi>pro bono publico,</hi> all persons are parties.

               <p>But <hi>Baron Turner</hi> said, That if the <hi>prior Incumbrance</hi> that was taken in, had been a <hi>Fee-simple</hi> upon a forfeited Mortgage, that then the second Mortgagee or Purchasor should not have a discovery, because then the whole Estate was absolutely in the first, and consequently the second could have no interest in it; but here the first Incumbrances were only Charges upon the Land, the Cognisees having no interest in it.</p>

               <p>Accordingly the <hi>Demurrer</hi> was waived, and the <hi>Attorny General</hi> replied, That Sir <hi>George Binion</hi> being the <hi>Kings Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver</hi> by Patent, took Security for this Debt in the <hi>Kings</hi> Name, for the use and benefit of him the said Sir <hi>George,</hi> and pleaded the <hi>Exception</hi> mentioned; to which the <hi>Defendant</hi> rejoined, and pleaded payment of the said Debt; to which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joinder</hi> the <hi>Attorny General demurred</hi> for want of alledging at what place the said Debt had been paid to the late <hi>Protector Oliver Cromwell;</hi> And now two <hi>Exceptions</hi> were taken to the <hi>Replication.</hi> 1.

                  <hi>Object.</hi> The <hi>Action</hi> is grounded upon the <hi>Record.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> That I deny, for it is not alledged as Matter of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> but as Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and the Allegation is immaterial; and concluded <hi>pro Querente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> It deserves consideration whether an <hi>Action</hi> lies at all, as this Case is, or not: For here the Goods are condemned as forfeited by Iudgment of the <hi>Court;</hi> and the party might have prevented that by coming in before Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon <hi>Proclamation</hi> and claiming Property; and if such an <hi>Action</hi> should be allowed, the Iudgment would be blowed off by a side-wind: and so in other <hi>Actions;</hi> as if a Man be convicted of <hi>Perjury,</hi> an <hi>Action upon the Case</hi> lies not, though the Prosecution were <hi>malitious.</hi> It has beén a great, doubt in this <hi>Court</hi> whether an <hi>Action of Trover</hi> lies after such a Condemnation, and adjudged at last that it does not. But if a particular person had come in, and claimed property, and lost them, yet the true Proprietor might have an <hi>Action of Trover,</hi> because he was no party to the former Suit; but here upon a Condemnation after Proclamation, it is otherwise. True it is, that such an <hi>Action</hi> would lie if upon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Bankrupts a Man should be found a Bankrupt without cause; So if Process of a <hi>Court</hi> be unduly served. For these are but Preparatories in the Course of the Suit; but after the Suit has had its effect, it would be hard, if such an <hi>Action</hi> should be admitted.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Variance</hi> betwixt the <hi>Declaration</hi> and the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> there is no question, but that although there were a mistake in the Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and sufficient Matter be found besides, that this does not vitiate the Declaration; but in Matter of <hi>Record</hi> it is otherwise; and therefore if the <hi>Action</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:52142:105"/> here had been grounded upon the <hi>Seizure</hi> only, all had been well; but it is grounded upon the <hi>Information,</hi> which is Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Record,</hi> as well as upon the <hi>Seizure,</hi> and hereupon the doubt arises. An Information <hi>tam quam,</hi> and an Information <hi>pro Protectore</hi> only, vary. If the Number or Nature of the Iustices were mistaken, it would have been a material variance, for it would not be the same <hi>Record.</hi> And here is no aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or allegation by way reference to the <hi>Record;</hi> but it is in the intituling part of the Declaration; and <hi>Damages</hi> given upon the <hi>whole Matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turner Baron.</hi> If Iudgment be given against a <hi>Plaintiff</hi> upon the forgery of a Bond in Issue, he cannot have such an <hi>Action;</hi> but here is no Iudgment given against any person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chief Baron.</hi> An <hi>Action</hi> does not lie against a Man that sues for <hi>Tythes</hi> that are not payable. Here are Mischiefs on both sides, and the Case is of great concernment. <hi>Et adjornatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>Hardres</hi> argued <hi>pro Defendente.</hi> The first que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is whether an <hi>Action</hi> lies at all, or no. The <hi>Point</hi> is; an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> is prosecuted here upon a Seizure of Goods, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed, and after <hi>Proclamation</hi> here made the Goods are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, according to the course of the <hi>Court,</hi> whereby the Goods are <hi>forfeited;</hi> and then the party brings an <hi>Action</hi> against the Informer for <hi>falsly</hi> and <hi>malitiously seizing</hi> and <hi>exhibiting</hi> this <hi>Information;</hi> and I conceive the <hi>Action</hi> lieth not. It is a Rule in <hi>Law,</hi> to which all the Books agree, that an <hi>Action upon the Case</hi> or an <hi>Action of Conspiracy</hi> lies for a <hi>false</hi> and <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> Prosecution, upon which the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> is <hi>acquitted</hi> or <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus</hi> found; and the reason is because now it appears there was no cause for it: The Party that was molested being now by Iudgment of the <hi>Court</hi> or other due Procéedings of Law acquitted or discharged; and therefore the Law allows him Recompence for such unjust Vexation, to prevent such undue Practices and Proceedings. Herewithal the Books agree, <hi>9 Rep. 55. les Poulter's Case, N. B. 114. 43 E. 3. 20. a. 27 E. 3. 80. N. B. 98, 116.</hi> But unless it were <hi>falsly</hi> and <hi>malitiously, Conspiracy</hi> lies not, <hi>35 H. 8. 14. 27 Ass. 12. Stamf. Pl. Cor. 173.</hi> But if a Man be prosecuted with all possible Violence, and with apparent Malice expressed in Words or otherwise, yet if the Prosecution were for a just cause, and the Party be condemned, such <hi>Action</hi> lies not, for the Law takes no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>Malice,</hi> where the Cause of the Prosecution is not <hi>false;</hi> as appears by the <hi>Books</hi> cited; and it is like the Case in <hi>13 H. 8. 16.</hi> Where an Officer by vertue of some legal Process arrests me, or a Stranger in Case of fire pull down my House, no <hi>Action</hi> lies, because it is <hi>damnum absque inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:52142:105"/> Now it appears in this case that upon a due course of Proceéding <hi>Judgment</hi> has béen given for the <hi>Forfeiture</hi> of these Goods; so that the exhibiting the <hi>Information</hi> cannot now be said to have béen done <hi>falsly</hi> and <hi>malitiously,</hi> because the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Court</hi> has passed upon it against the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and all Iudgments of <hi>Courts</hi> are presumed to be just, and given upon good grounds. And though Malice and an Invention to cause the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> to lose his Goods are alledged, yet if there be no <hi>Falsehood</hi> in the Case the <hi>Action</hi> lies not; for these are but Accidents and Ingredients and Accessory; they are not the ground and foundation of the Suit; But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice and <hi>Falshood</hi> is a thing to be considered, which cannot be objected <hi>after Judgment,</hi> for these Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> If this were admitted, it would open a way to avoid and defeat the fruit of all Iudgments by a collateral way; for all that has béen recovered by the Iudgment might be recovered again in damages, if such Proceeding be allowed, <hi>1 &amp; 2 Ph. &amp; Mar. Dyer 14. Vaux's Case.</hi> He having an Office of one of the <hi>Philizers,</hi> was put out of it by the <hi>Court</hi> for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and farming it, and <hi>Keble</hi> put in his room; and no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord made of <hi>Vaux's</hi> discharge; nor was he called to answer for himself. And in an <hi>Assize</hi> he would have had this Matter examined over again; but it was not admitted, because it would draw in question the Proceeding of the <hi>Court. 3 Eliz. Dyer 201.</hi> The like in case of a Iudgment given upon <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection</hi> of all <hi>Infant.</hi> If a Man be convicted for <hi>Forgery</hi> of a Deed, he cannot have an <hi>Action of Trover</hi> for the Deéd so long as his Conviction is in force.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> If this <hi>Action</hi> were allowed, it would discourage and overthrow all Proceedings of this nature; because after Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given for the <hi>Informer,</hi> he would not be sure that he was in peace, but would be liable to be disquieted by another <hi>Action</hi> for <hi>malitious</hi> Prosecution; and this would be a mean to prevent, if not to subvert all Iustice, which the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects and advances; especially in these Cases, where the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> get nothing to themselves. If a Man be endicted and acquitted, no <hi>Action</hi> lies against the <hi>Enditors,</hi> because they are returned by due Process of Law, to make enquiry for the service of the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> and such <hi>Actions</hi> would have a tendency to the smothering of great Offences, <hi>N. B. 115. 22 Ass. 77. 27 Ass. 2.</hi> After a Conviction by a <hi>Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Jury,</hi> an <hi>Action</hi> will lie against no person; because it would beget infinite Vexation, and be an occasion of much Perjury; and of smothering Offences; and persons would be deterred from serving the <hi>King, 27 Ass. 12. Co. 12 Rep. 23.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52142:106"/> Cam. Stell. Pasch. 5 Jac.</hi> It lies not in case of <hi>Treason,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every Man is under a particular Obligation to discover that; and they would be discouraged to make discoveries if they were liable to <hi>Actions;</hi> and therefore for causing one to be endicted of <hi>Treason</hi> an <hi>Action</hi> lies not, though the Party be acquitted, <hi>Lovet</hi> and <hi>Faulkner's Case, Bulstr. 2 Rep. 270.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All these Cases that have or can be cited, come under these considerations, <hi>viz.</hi> either the Party was <hi>acquitted;</hi> or the Matter <hi>coram non Judice;</hi> or the <hi>Proceedings</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> not controlled, but affirmed, as in the Case of a <hi>second Execution;</hi> or in a Case of Matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> which are untrue, as in Case of a Suit against his own Release, and so found. But it does not appear by any Case that I have met with, that a <hi>Plaintiff</hi> shall be admitted to sue for a <hi>false</hi> and <hi>malitious Prosecution</hi> contrary to a Iudgment or Matter of Record, which affirms it to be true; which is our Case.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, There is no President shewn of any such <hi>Action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 2d <hi>Part</hi> of the Case is this, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> declares that the <hi>Defendant tam pro Domino Protectore quam pro seipso</hi> preferred this <hi>Information;</hi> and the <hi>Jury</hi> have found that the <hi>Defendant</hi> exhibited it <hi>pro Protectore</hi> only. Whether this <hi>Variance</hi> be such as that it shall not be said to be the <hi>same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> And I conceive it cannot be intended to be the <hi>same,</hi> for these Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Every Man is presumed to know his own Case best. If a Man be bound to two, and one of them only sue; or if threé Men are bound, and the <hi>Action</hi> brought against two only, in both Cases the <hi>Action</hi> is naught, unless it appear to the <hi>Court</hi> that the other person is dead, <hi>28 H. 6. 3. 36 H. 6. 16. 6 E. 4. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Maters of <hi>Record</hi> if there be any <hi>Variance</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> is yet more scrupulous. Iudgment in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> for Sir <hi>George Sherley Baronet,</hi> and in a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> he is called <hi>Knight</hi> and <hi>Baronet;</hi> and held that the <hi>Record</hi> is not hereby removed, <hi>Sherly <hi>versus</hi> Underhil, Hob. 468.</hi> If a Iudgment were given before <hi>nine persons,</hi> and the Writ of <hi>Error</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it to have béen given before <hi>eight,</hi> it is not good, nor is the <hi>Record</hi> removed by it, <hi>Cro. 2 Rep. 254.</hi> So if a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> suppose the Iudgment to have béen given <hi>coram The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saurario &amp; Baronibus,</hi> and it was given <hi>coram Baronibus</hi> only, it is naught, and does not remove the <hi>Record, 28 H. 6. 11. b. 12. a.</hi> In Error of a <hi>Pleint</hi> supposed to be against <hi>two,</hi> which in truth was against <hi>three,</hi> of whom <hi>two</hi> were found <hi>guilty</hi> and the other <hi>acquitted; per Curiam</hi> the <hi>Record</hi> is not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

B. R.</hi> By these Cases it appears plainly that in case of a <hi>Record</hi> the <hi>Certificate</hi> and <hi>Return</hi> must agree with the <hi>Writ,</hi> or else that it is naught. Now here is a greater <hi>Variance</hi> than in the Cases cited; for there the <hi>Variance</hi> is only in the <hi>Numbers, Additions, &amp;c.</hi> of the Persons; but here the <hi>Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> is in the <hi>entituling</hi> part of the Suit, which is the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:</hi> For an <hi>Information tam quam</hi> and an <hi>Information pro Rege</hi> only, can never be intended to be the same <hi>Information,</hi> no more than in the Cases alledged the <hi>Record</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Writ</hi> and that in the <hi>Certificate</hi> or <hi>Return</hi> can be intended the same.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Six</hi> things are to be considered in this Case. <hi>1.</hi> How the Law stands upon the express words, and penning of several Statute Laws concerning this matter. <hi>2.</hi> What construction ought to be made by the Rules of Law, without offering any violence or injury to the Words, upon these several Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Laws. <hi>3.</hi> For what reasons <hi>new Draperies</hi> made from time to time since the enacting of these Laws, shall be drawn within the compass of them. <hi>4.</hi> How other Laws of the like nature have been expounded. <hi>5.</hi> What <hi>Objections</hi> may be made, and <hi>Answers</hi> given in the Case. And <hi>6.</hi> What <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents</hi> and <hi>Authorities</hi> there are in the Case.</p>
               <p>For better order and method sake, I will begin with a short recital of such Statutes as conduce to the Case in question; and passing the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>2 Ed. 3. cap. 14.</hi> which directs the <hi>Assize</hi> of <hi>Cloaths;</hi> and the <hi>25 Ed. 3. cap. 1.</hi> which are of no force; I will begin with <hi>27 Ed. 3. cap. 4.</hi> which was the first that gave any Duty of <hi>Aulnage,</hi> or <hi>Aulnagers</hi> Fees; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause former <hi>Laws</hi> were grievous in respect of <hi>Forfeitures,</hi> for the releasing of those Forfeitures in ease of the People, and for a convenient Recompence to be made to the <hi>King</hi> for the same, that Law was made upon the Peoples offer to give the <hi>King</hi> a Recompence; whereupon the <hi>King</hi> reciting the Complaint made to him, and the <hi>Peoples</hi> offer of a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and the release of the said Forfeitures accruing to him for the defectiveness of Cloaths not of <hi>Assize,</hi> enacts, That the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Aulnager</hi> shall have certain Fees there as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained for every whole and half Cloath; which Law was made and grounded upon a mutual Recompence betwixt <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> After this Statute many Laws were made for the better regulation and execution of the Office of <hi>Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager,</hi> without any dispute of the Duty; as <hi>11 H. 4. cap. 6. 4 Ed. 4. cap. 1. 8 Ed. 4. cap. 1. 1 R. 3. cap. 8.</hi> all which make nothing in the Case in question: But in process of time when new Inventions sprang up of making other sorts of Cloth, this introduced divers other Laws for the <hi>Aulnagers</hi> direction, without giving any new Fee to the <hi>King</hi> or the <hi>Aulnager;</hi> but proportioning this original Fee, which was a Standard for all others; and therefore by an express Law made <hi>anno 17 R. 2.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52142:110"/> cap. 2.</hi> Power is given to put to sale all <hi>Kerseys</hi> (then newly invented) and all other Cloaths of any length or breadth, paying the Subsidy and <hi>Aulnage</hi> after the rate aforesaid, which is an express, full and clear Law for the Duty to be paid for all manner of Cloaths, without exception or restraint. The <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>H. 6. cap. 9.</hi> was made to explain the word <hi>(Cloth)</hi> in the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>7 H. 4. cap. 10.</hi> and <hi>11 H. 4. cap. 6.</hi> and enacts, That they shall not extend to <hi>Streights</hi> made, or to be made; but it goes farther, having special regard to the Duty, <hi>without impeachment of any the Kings Officers, or of the Duty of Aulnage, Customs or other Dues, 1 H. 4. cap. 14. 9 H. 4. cap. 2.</hi> by a particular Law then made <hi>Kersies, Kendal-Cloth, Coventry-Freeze</hi> and <hi>Cogware</hi> are exempted from all manner of Subsidies for three years, <hi>except Aulnage,</hi> by which it is plain, that without such an Exception they would have been liable; and there is no Law, but that of <hi>27 Ed. 3. cap. 4.</hi> which gives any <hi>certain</hi> Duty to the <hi>King,</hi> except for <hi>Kersies;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Law is to be looked as the Rule and Square for all. The <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>Eliz. cap. 2.</hi> reciting, that divers <hi>Lancashire-Cottons, Freezes</hi> and <hi>Rug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> had been sold without the <hi>Aulna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> Seal set to them, in deceit of the <hi>Aulnager</hi> of his accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Fee; and therefore enacts, that none shall be sold before the <hi>Aulnagers</hi> Seal be set to them: By which Law the <hi>Parliament</hi> admits, that the Duty of <hi>Aulnage</hi> is due for <hi>new Draperies,</hi> without any particular Laws being made concerning them.</p>
               <p>So that upon perusal of all these <hi>Laws,</hi> it appears that the Duty of <hi>Aulnage</hi> was always admitted, and never disputed according to the proportion of <hi>27 Ed. 3. cap. 4.</hi> and <hi>17 R. 2. cap. 2.</hi> so that in truth the proper question now to be made, is, What proportion such <hi>new Draperies</hi> ought to bear, rather than whether they shall pay at all or no? But the question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>proportion</hi> is not now in dispute, nor do the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants</hi> raise any question concerning it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> Consideration is, admitting there may be some doubt concerning the <hi>Duty</hi> being due or not, whether it be not within the <hi>meaning,</hi> though not within the words of the <hi>Law?</hi> For the clearing of which, I shall take for a Ground what is laid down in <hi>3 Rep. Heydons Case,</hi> That it is the Office of an Expositor, to suppress subtil Inventions, and Evasions <hi>pro bono privato,</hi> and to add force and life to the Remedy provided according to the true Intention of the <hi>Law-makers.</hi> Vpon this ground it is there resolved, That <hi>Copy-hold Estates</hi> are within <hi>31 H. 8. Of Dissolution of, &amp;c.</hi> against doubling of <hi>Estates,</hi> one upon another, before the <hi>dissolution,</hi> because there is the same mischief in them, that there is in

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52142:111"/> answer would have been, that a proportionable Duty of <hi>Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> should be paid for such new <hi>Draperies,</hi> with respect to the kind and quality of them.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> The third thing to be considered is, For what reason such <hi>new Draperies</hi> ought to pay such a <hi>Duty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first Reason</hi> is drawn from the Ground and Reason of making these Laws, which (as appears by <hi>Co. Mag. Chart. p. 606.</hi>) was by reason of a Record there cited out of <hi>24 Ed. 3. Excheq. Rot. 13.</hi> That a great part of the Wooll of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was converted into Cloth, and Custom being due for Wooll of common Right, and it being an Inheritance in the Crown, and not due by Grant or Benevolence, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>1 Eliz. Dyer 165.</hi> Sir <hi>John Davies Rep. 8. b. 31 H. 8. Dyer 43. 1 Mar. Dyer 92.</hi> and <hi>9 H. 6. 12.</hi> for that reason the <hi>King</hi> departing with his own proper Right and Inheritance, which by that means was diminished, the Law gave him a perdurable Duty in lieu of it; which reason holds here in proportion for the expence of Wooll in such <hi>new Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries;</hi> and the reason is the same in all <hi>Exchanges</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranties</hi> for a Recovery in proportion, and of the Writ of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution</hi> betwixt <hi>Jointenants, F. N. B. 163. &amp; per Bracton lib. 1. cap. 4. Aequitas est rerum convenientia, quae paribus in causis paria Jura desiderat.</hi> And the Law of Equality and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the most equal and just Law, and most consonant to Reason.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second Reason</hi> is grounded upon the words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>27 Ed. 3. cap. 4.</hi> especially upon the Statute of <hi>17 R. 2. cap. 2.</hi> by the first of these a Release as it were is given by the <hi>King,</hi> upon condition to have in lieu such a Duty upon the Consumption of <hi>Wooll</hi> in Manufacture; in which the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the then present Manufacture was not considerable; but the expence of <hi>Wooll</hi> which occasioned it: and the words of <hi>17 R. 2.</hi> are express <hi>for all Cloaths in proportion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Law of <hi>27 Ed. 3.</hi> and the reason of it is supported by another like Case; as that of <hi>10 Ed. 4. Taltarums Case</hi> of Common Recoveries, notwithstanding the Statute <hi>de donis conditionalibus,</hi> by reason of the reciprocal Benefit by recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in value.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> Certainly a <hi>Custom</hi> was due to the <hi>King</hi> at Common Law for <hi>Wooll, Wooll-fells</hi> and <hi>Leather</hi> long before the giving of half a Mark by the <hi>Statute of Edw. 1.</hi> and that appears by the <hi>Red-Book</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> but not according to the proportion settled by that <hi>Statute;</hi> but some Custom was due and paid: Also without all dispute there was an <hi>Assise</hi> of Cloth and Draperies before the <hi>Statute of 2 Ed. 3.</hi> to wit, at <hi>Northampton</hi> in the time of <hi>King Rich. I.</hi> who made an Ordinance for the <hi>Assise</hi> of Cloaths; as appears by <hi>Roger Hoveden:</hi> and see the <hi>Statutes of 4</hi> and <hi>7 Jac. 5.</hi> and <hi>6 Ed. 6.</hi> and <hi>2</hi> and <hi>3 Ph.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> concerning the better ordering of Cloaths, and paying the <hi>Aulnage</hi> in proportion. <hi>Et adjornatur.</hi>

               <p>In <hi>Hill. Term, Annis 13</hi> and <hi>14 Car. 2.</hi> The Case was argued by <hi>Strode pro Defendente,</hi> and by <hi>Sir Heneage Finch pro Querente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Trinity Term, Anno 14 Car. 2.</hi> The <hi>Court</hi> delivered their Opinions, all agreeing <hi>pro Querente; viz. Baron Turnet, Baron Atkins</hi> and <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> There are <hi>two</hi> sorts of <hi>Draperies,</hi> one sort of <hi>Strait weaving,</hi> and the other of <hi>Frost weaving,</hi> as <hi>Kersies, &amp;c.</hi> Cloaths were made here before the time of <hi>King Edw. I.</hi> as in the Reigns <hi>Rich. I. Hen. II. Hen. III. &amp;c.</hi> as appears by divers Grants made to Guilds and Fraternities before that time, and by Reservations of Fee-farm Rents; but the Trade was not great till <hi>King Edw. I's</hi> time. There was likewise a Subsidy of <hi>Aulnage</hi> due before the time of <hi>King Edw. III.</hi> though not the same Subsidy; as appears by <hi>52 H. 3. Statute de Scaccario,</hi> but it was reduced to a more certain Rate; but there was then no Custom payable for them, but in Case of <hi>Exportation</hi> only. There was <hi>Aulnage</hi> before the <hi>Statute of 27 Ed. 3.</hi> as appears <hi>13 Ed. 3. membr. 2.</hi> there was then a Measurer of Cloaths. Now for the present question, Whether the Subsidy of <hi>Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> be due for <hi>Bays,</hi> though the <hi>Statute of 27 Ed. 3.</hi> extend not to them, but to particular Cloaths there mentioned; it will be hard to bring them within that Law, because they differ in weight, length and breadth; yet there is a concurrent Law made in <hi>17 R. 2.</hi> which makes the quantity a necessary ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:52142:114"/> to the Subsidy; for <hi>17 R. 2.</hi> proportions the Subsidy given by <hi>27 Ed. 3.</hi> which settles the Duty only; and therefore I ground my Opinion for the Duty upon <hi>17 R. 2.</hi> the words of which <hi>Statute</hi> are, <hi>paying the Duty according to the Rate,</hi> which words bring the <hi>Statute of 27 Ed. 3.</hi> to that of <hi>17 R. 2.</hi> and upon both these Statutes taken together, the Duty arises, and the Penalty for non-payment of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 17 R. 2.</hi> mentions not <hi>Bays,</hi> but <hi>Cloaths</hi> and <hi>Kersies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The generality of the words, <hi>Cloaths, as well Kersies as other,</hi> comprise all; and there cannot be more significant and comprehensive words to include all manner of <hi>Cloaths;</hi> and by the <hi>Demurrer</hi> they are confessed to be <hi>Cloaths,</hi> as they are laid in the Information.</p>
               <p>A <hi>second</hi> Reason I take from several other Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which explains <hi>17 R. 2.</hi> as <hi>1 H. 4. cap. 19. 9 H. 4. nu. 3. 4.</hi> which give a relaxation of this Subsidy for a certain time only; and only for some particular <hi>Cloaths</hi> there mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 11 H. 6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> That Act only enacts, that <hi>Straits</hi> shall not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cloaths</hi> within the <hi>Statute of H. 4.</hi> but they are notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that within <hi>17 R. 2.</hi> and so in effect the <hi>Statute</hi> it self says, and refers to <hi>17 R. 2.</hi> and by the <hi>Statute of 4 Ed. 4. cap. 1.</hi> and <hi>4 Ed. 6. cap.</hi> compared with <hi>7 Ed. 4. cap. 5.</hi> it appears that the Subsidy of <hi>Aulnage</hi> is due for Straits; so is <hi>1 R. 3. cap. 8. 8 Eliz. 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The <hi>Statute of 6 Ed. 6.</hi> begat that of <hi>8 Eliz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> Those Laws do not create the Duty, but refer for that to the <hi>17 R. 2.</hi> And by the last Clause in <hi>4 Jac.</hi> the Duty is saved.</p>
               <p>My <hi>third</hi> Reason is grounded upon the Iudgment given in <hi>1 Jac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> By that Iudgment <hi>Norwich Worsteds</hi> were not to pay the <hi>Subsidy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> It is true, they do not come within the General Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance of <hi>Cloath</hi> granted by <hi>Patent, 3 Ed. 3.</hi> and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed in the Parliament of <hi>5 Ed. 3. Rot. 13.</hi> and <hi>22 Ed. 3. nu. ult.</hi> and by <hi>11 H. 4. nu. 39.</hi> the Government of <hi>Worsteds</hi> is committed to those <hi>Norwich</hi> for four years only; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the time was enlarged by <hi>7 H. 4. cap. 1.</hi> and <hi>4.</hi> which appoint <hi>Wardens:</hi> and it is true, there has been no Decree that the Subsidy should be paid for them; but this is not now the <hi>question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My <hi>fourth</hi> Reason is grounded upon Iudicial Presidents, in such Cases, in the <hi>Reigns</hi> of <hi>Queen Eliz. King James</hi> and <hi>King Charles I.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The proportion ought to be according to the weight of Broad-Cloth, for it cannot be otherwise; and by the <hi>Statute of 4 Jac. cap. 2.</hi> the weight of Broad-Cloth appears to be <hi>64 l.</hi> and to contain <hi>24</hi> yards; <hi>vide etiam</hi> the <hi>Statute of 4 Ed. 4.</hi> for the <hi>weight;</hi> so he concluded <hi>pro Quer.</hi> and Iudgment was given accordingly; but the Forfeiture was remitted, paying the Duty, by consent of the Parties.</p>

               </p>
               <p>After which it was moved in <hi>Arrest of Judgment;</hi> and threé Exceptions principally insisted on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That it is not said and averred to be <hi>in auditu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plurimorum, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>3.</hi> That it is not averred, that upon the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> when the words were spoken, the Suggestions were read and repeated, whereby the By-standers might apprehend what they were.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>1st Exception,</hi> the omission of <hi>in auditu compluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum</hi> is added after <hi>Verdict;</hi> and so it has been adjudged in <hi>Smart</hi> and <hi>Easedales Case, Cro. 3 Rep. 199.</hi> and in <hi>Heel</hi> and <hi>Taylors Case,</hi> in <hi>Mich. 43</hi> and <hi>44 Eliz. in Communi Banco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>second</hi> there is a mistake in it; for the answer to <hi>John de la Bar</hi> was not any way relating to the matter referred; for nothing was referred but this Question, whether the Letters Patents of Revocation were good or not, and whether the <hi>Defendant</hi> had a legal Grant? which no way concerns the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions upon which the Action is grounded; for be the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions true or false, the said Revocation and the Grant to the <hi>Defendant</hi> may be good; the validity whereof was the only thing that was referred to the Attorny General; and not the truth or falshood of the Suggestions: So that the affirming that the Suggestions, which in themselves are scandalous, were true, cannot be said to have been by way of <hi>Evidence</hi> or <hi>Justification,</hi> being wholly collateral to the matter then in question, <hi>Vide Brook</hi> and <hi>Mountagues Case, Cro. 2 Rep. 90.</hi> and <hi>Eyres <hi>contra</hi> Sedgewicke, Cro. 2 Rep. 601. Co. 12 Rep. 128.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the <hi>3d Exception</hi> he said, that this Case differed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly from the Case in <hi>4 Co. Buckly</hi> and <hi>Woods Case;</hi> for there it does not appear that any thing was spoken but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Parties themselves; but here the Discourse is with <hi>Stangers.</hi> And it will be strongly presumed that the <hi>Stranger</hi> in this Case knew what the Suggestions were, or else he could not have affirmed that they were false; for it shall not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed that a Man will affirm a thing to be true or false, which he knows nothing of; and so strong an Intendment will supply a defect in the Declaration.</p>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:52142:122"/> the cause of Demurrer was, because the Defendant recites the seizure to have been <hi>per quandam Inquisitionem,</hi> which is uncertain; <hi>sed non allocatur,</hi> because it is only by way of recital of the Inquisition, which was before set forth in the <hi>Scire Facias</hi> by the words <hi>per quandam Inquisitionem,</hi> and no other shall be presumed to be in the Case.</p>

               <p>The Defendant pleads, That at the time of the Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the said Wines in the Information mentioned, and long before, he was and still is <hi>a Citizen of London;</hi> and that by a <hi>Charter</hi> Granted to the said <hi>City of London,</hi> in the <hi>First year</hi> of the Reign of King <hi>Edward the First,</hi> no <hi>Prizage</hi> is to be taken of the Wines of the <hi>Citizens of London</hi> against their Wills, but that thereof they are by the said <hi>Charter</hi> for ever quit: The Words of the <hi>Charter</hi> being these; <hi>viz.

                  <hi>Hardres</hi> for the <hi>Defendant:</hi> First, This <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>King Edward the First,</hi> upon which this Priviledge is grounded, was Granted for the Advancement and Encouragement of Trade and Merchandize, which are (as it were) the Blood which gives nourishment to the Body Politick of this Kingdom; and therefore it ought to receive a favourable and benign Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for the better support and maintenance of Trade and Commerce, the advancement whereof is of great considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Eye of the Law. Insomuch that 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5.5. A Bond taken to debar a Man from following his <hi>Trade,</hi> is void in Law. And upon this ground it was, that a <hi>Charter</hi> granted by <hi>King Edward the Third, Anno Regni Tertio,</hi> To <hi>Almains</hi> and other <hi>Foreign Merchants,</hi> that they might safely and securely come into <hi>England</hi> with their Merchandizes, and should be free
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:52142:124"/> from <hi>Pontage, Murage,</hi> and other like <hi>Tolls</hi> throughout the Kingdom, has been held to be a good Grant: Although the Grantees were no Corporation capable regularly of such a Priviledge; and although such words do not by a general Intendment of Law make them a Corporation: As a Grant <hi>Probis hominibus de Islington,</hi> without reserving a Rent, does not make them a Corporation. <hi>Vide Dyer</hi> 1 <hi>Mariae, fol.</hi> 100. <hi>a.</hi> 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 14. Yet in regard that the said Grant was made for the Encouragement of <hi>Merchants,</hi> and the <hi>Advancement of Trade,</hi> it has been expounded <hi>Secundum Legem Mercatoriam;</hi> which is <hi>Jus Gentium,</hi> and not according to the usual and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon course of expounding <hi>Charters</hi> by the Rules of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law. <hi>Vide Co.

               <p>And in <hi>Co.</hi> 11. <hi>Rep.</hi> 69, 70. <hi>Magdalen Colledge Case,</hi> it is Adjudged,<note place="margin">13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 10.</note> that the <hi>King</hi> is within the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> whereby <hi>Colledges, Deans and Chapters, Hospitals, Parsons, Vicars, &amp;c.</hi> are prohibited to make any <hi>Leases, Gifts, Grants, &amp;c. to any person or persons, Bodies Politick or Corporate, other than for One and twenty Years, or three Lives;</hi> the reason of which Resolution is express'd to be, because Laws made for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion and Learning, and the relief of the Poor, ought to have an ample Construction, and shall be extended as far as the words will reach: And the <hi>King</hi> being included within the Generality of the words, shall not be exempted by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; because <hi>Summa ratio est, quae pro Religione facit.</hi> But now, by <hi>Merchandize</hi> and <hi>Trade</hi> Religion is maintained, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature advanced, and the Poor cherish'd; all which would suffer a visible decay, if Trade were obstructed: Especially in this Kingdom, which being an Island, is in a great measure maintain'd, and the Crown it self supported by Trade, as one of its main Pillars. And therefore I conceive that a Charter granted as in Our case, for the Advancement of Trade, ought to have a liberal and beneficial Exposition in order thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pasch. 9. <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. Rot. 163.</note>In the Ninth year of <hi>King James the First,</hi> in <hi>Com. Banc.</hi> it was held in one <hi>Hanger's Case,</hi> by the Opinions of four Iustices and three Barons against three other Iustices, That the <hi>Wines</hi> of <hi>Hanger</hi> a <hi>Citizen of London,</hi> which arrived in the Port of <hi>London</hi> in two Ships, but whereof the Bulks were not broke in his life time; and in two other Ships, which did not arrive till after his, death should be discharged of <hi>Prizage.</hi> And yet at the time when the <hi>Prizage</hi> became due, <hi>Hanger</hi> was no <hi>Citizen,</hi> but a dead Corps; and consequently according to the Letter of the <hi>Charter,</hi> and by common Intendment thereupon, those Wines ought to have paid the Duty; for that in truth they were the Goods of his Executors in point of Property and Interest.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:52142:124"/> And if in that case a sort of strained Construction was made to extend and enlarge the Exemption, beyond the Literal sense of the Words; I hope that in this case a plain, natural and genuine Exposition at least, shall be admitted to exempt a <hi>Citizen,</hi> being <hi>re &amp; nomine</hi> such, from the <hi>Prizage</hi> of these Wines.</p>
               <p>My second Reason is taken from the Circumstances of the Persons, to whom this <hi>Grant</hi> was made. It was made to the <hi>City of London,</hi> the Metropolitan City, the Heart and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the whole Kingdom, the King's Chamber, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants whereof fill his Coffers by their Customs, and supply the Subjects with Necessaries, and increase the Honour of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by their Commerce and Traffick abroad, and strengthen it by their Shipping at home: And therefore great reason there is, that the several <hi>Charters</hi> granted in favour of the <hi>City,</hi> and whereby Immunities are granted to them, should receive a large and benign Construction.</p>
               <p>Vpon this ground it is that so many, so large and ample Grants have been from time to time made to the City, by the several Kings of <hi>England</hi> successively: And it is upon the same Reason, as appears by <hi>Co.</hi> 8 <hi>Rep. The Case of the City of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that many Customs against common Right, and the Rule of the Common Law, and which alter the Course of Iustice, are allowable there, though no where else: As for Example, A Custom to Arrest a man for Debt before it become due: A Custom for a Beadle to search a man's House for Suspicious persons, and to arrest and imprison them: A Custom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an Executor may pay a Debt upon a simple Contract before a Debt due upon Bond; and others of like nature: Which cannot be said to receive their Validity from Acts of Parliament; for since they would be void in themselves, if pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to in other places, a General Confirmation by Act of Parliament, of the Customs of the City, would not make them good there. But the great respect which the Law has to the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the Causes aforesaid, is the reason why such Customs and Priviledges are allow'd to obtain in, and have been granted to the said City, as no other City within the Kingdom does, or by Law can enjoy without a special Act of Parliament. Vpon the same Reason it is, that by the <hi>Statute of Magna Charta,</hi> the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>City of London</hi> are saved by Name, though no other Town or City in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular be named, <hi>Magn. Chart. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>viz.</hi> by reason of its Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, and of the great regard that <hi>London</hi> is of before other places, as being the support of the Trade of the Nation, and the great Mart and Staple of all Commodities.</p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:52142:125"/>
               <p>My third Reason is; Because if the <hi>Discharge granted</hi> by this <hi>Charter</hi> did not extend to <hi>Citizens Wines</hi> imported <hi>else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where</hi> than at <hi>London,</hi> it would be a means to lessen the Trade of the City, which is the support of the Citizens. For the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> being as it were the Magazine of all Foreign Trade, cannot be supported and maintained in its Grandeur by importing Goods into the <hi>Thames</hi> only; but the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>London</hi> import into all parts of the Kingdom, to supply all places with their Merchandize: And if they do not enjoy this Exemption elsewhere, as well as in their own Port, it would tend to the lessening of their Trade, and thwart the design of Granting them this Priviledge. For the Wealth of the City arises by the freedom of Trade, and Encouragement given to the Citizens by their Liberties and Franchises, and by a fair and candid Interpretation and Construction of them.</p>
               <p>My fourth Reason is; Because this <hi>Grant</hi> enures by way of <hi>Discharge</hi> and <hi>Exemption</hi> from a Burthen, to which the Citizens had before been liable: And such Grants have always been Expounded more beneficially than others, upon this ground, that <hi>Favores ampliandi sunt▪</hi> And upon this Ground the case is put 19 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.62. The <hi>Rector of Edington's</hi> Case. And 38 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 10, <hi>b. per Danvers,</hi> If the King grant to a Parson, that he and his Successors shall be quit of the payment of Tenths, when granted by Parliament; this is a good Grant, being by way of Discharge. But if the King should make a Grant of Tenths to be granted to him by Parliament, the Grant would be void, 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. <hi>Grants</hi> 29. The same appears by <hi>Charters of Pardon,</hi> which are always expounded extensively for the party. So General <hi>Pardons by Act of Parliament;</hi> as the <hi>Stat. of</hi> 43 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 19. <hi>Of Pardon,</hi> cited 6 <hi>Rep. in Edward Phitton's Case:</hi> The Act Excepts the Process of <hi>Cap' Utlagat' ad satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faciendum,</hi> till such time as the party Outlawed make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; yet it is held and adjudged, that if he die before satifaction made, his Executors may make satisfaction, and shall thereupon be admitted to the benefit of the Pardon. So <hi>Co.</hi> 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 18, <hi>b. Sir Tho. Cecil's Case,</hi> It is held upon the Statute of 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 39. for <hi>alledging, pleading, and declaring Matter in Law, Reason or good Conscience in discharge of the King's Debt,</hi> that the said Statute does not extend to the Cases only that are expresly there provided for, but to all other Cases by Construction. Wherefore since Acts and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Grace and Bounty have always received an Extensive Interpretation, at least so far forth as the words will bear, I hope that in this case the Charter, upon which the Question arises, being a Charter of Grace, will receive a like interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:52142:125"/> for the honour of the King and benefit of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>My fifth Reason is grounded upon this Rule, which holds in all Cases of Grants from the Crown; <hi>viz.</hi> That the King's Grants shall be construed largely and liberally with respect to all such things as are in particular granted by Name, though not with respect to all such things as may seem to be comprized within General words. <hi>Co.</hi> 1 <hi>Rep. Altonwood's Case;</hi> If the King grant <hi>Bona &amp; Catalla felonum,</hi> Obligations and things in Action will pass; As <hi>Walter Chief Baron</hi> said in <hi>Clayton's</hi> Case, 4 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>in Scaccar.</hi> Vpon the <hi>Stat. of</hi> 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>Of Pardon,</hi> that it had been Adjudged in <hi>Mich.</hi> 39 <hi>&amp;</hi> 40 <hi>Eliz. in B. R. Inter Essington &amp; Barker, Pasch.</hi> 12 <hi>Car. B.C.</hi> in an Action upon the <hi>Stat. de</hi> 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. for payment of Tithes, it was held clearly, that if the King make a <hi>Grant</hi> of <hi>Tithes, All</hi> sorts of Tithes pass thereby: But the Doubt in that case was occasioned by a <hi>Vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet</hi> in the Grant, <hi>viz. of such and such things;</hi> and the Question was, Whether Tithes of <hi>other</hi> things, that were not named, would pass; but if the <hi>Videlicet</hi> had been out of the Case, there would have been no scruple, but that all sorts of Tithes had passed. So if the King Grants <hi>Conusance of Pleas in Debt,</hi> the Grant extends to Debts upon Record, as well as to other Debts: <hi>Long's Case, Hill.</hi> 22 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>B.R.</hi> 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 50. Grant or Goods forfeited <hi>pro feloniâ vel alio delicto, per quod forisfacere potest catalla,</hi> extends to Outlawry in Debt or Trespass. <hi>Hob. p.</hi> 302, 303. <hi>Holland vers. Shelly:</hi> Grant of the goods of <hi>Outlaws</hi> extends to all manner of Outlawries. So in this Case, the <hi>Citizens</hi> shall have all favour of being discharged of <hi>Prizage,</hi> which they may have without offering Violence and Injury to the Words of the <hi>Charter:</hi> But for the <hi>Citizens of London,</hi> to be discharged of <hi>Prizage</hi> for <hi>Wines</hi> imported else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where than at <hi>London,</hi> is as much within the Letter of their <hi>Charter,</hi> as to be discharged thereof for <hi>Wines</hi> imported into the Port of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My sixth Reason is, That the place of Importation is not limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Charter, nor, as I conceive, ought it to be limited and restrained by Construction: <hi>Ubi Charta non distinguit, nec nos distinguere debemus.</hi> And it is a general Rule, that <hi>Clausula Generalis generaliter est Interpretanda.</hi> And another Maxim we have, that <hi>Propositio indefinita aequipoller Universali.</hi> 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. 4. 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 44. If the <hi>King</hi> Grants to an Abbot, that he shall be discharged of the payment of Tenths granted <hi>per totum Clerum Angliae,</hi> these General words shall discharge such an Abbot from the payment of Tenths granted by the Clergy of the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> though not granted by
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52142:126"/> the <hi>Totus Clerus Angliae;</hi> and though the Abbot himself be one of the Grantors: Because such <hi>Grants</hi> of <hi>Exemption</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi> have always had a large and beneficial Construction.</p>
               <p>It has been strongly objected by the other side, that in this very <hi>Charter,</hi> the Clauses that go before and follow after this Clause of Discharge of <hi>Prizage,</hi> and which concern the Citizens being exempted from <hi>Purveyances, &amp;c.</hi> have these words in them; <hi>viz. tam extra quam infra Civitatem:</hi> Which words being not inserted into this Clause concerning <hi>Prizage,</hi> they infer the Intention of the Grant to have been, That they should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of <hi>Prizage</hi> only for <hi>Wines</hi> imported <hi>infra,</hi> and not <hi>extrà Civitatem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I Answer, <hi>First,</hi> That many Clauses are inserted into <hi>Patents,</hi> rather for explanation than to enlarge the Grant; and sometimes Clauses that are not at all necessary: And the like we see in Acts of Parliament. <hi>vid.</hi> 1st <hi>Rep.</hi> 24. <hi>b. Porter's Case,</hi> and in 4 <hi>Co. fo.</hi> 72. <hi>b. Burrough's Case;</hi> if the King make a Lease rendering Rent at the Receit of the Exchequer, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of his Baliff; these words are redundant, and the Law would imply them, though they were not exprest: And therefore if the King should Grant the Reversion of such a Lease over, the Grantée must demand the Rent upon the Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Clause in this <hi>Charter</hi> that concerns <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge</hi> of <hi>Prizage,</hi> imports a Grant of a quite other thing, and of a different nature, and that has no dependance upon the Clauses precedent or subsequent: But is a Clause that stands by it self, and is not affected by any Words, that may be inserted into any of them. And this may appear by the Case afore-cited, of <hi>Holland and Shelley, Hob.</hi> 302, 303. Where the King Grants the Goods, <hi>quorumcunque Utlagatorum &amp; Utlagand.</hi> But the Clause preceding mentions, <hi>omnia &amp; omnimoda bona &amp; catalla quorumcunque felonum,</hi> and the Clause subsequent is, <hi>omnium &amp; singulorum pro feloniâ in Exigend' qualitercunque posit' &amp; ponend.</hi> And the Question was, Whether the Goods and Chattels of a Person <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law'd for Debt or Trespass</hi> passed by this Grant? And it was resolved, that they did, though that Clause of <hi>quorumcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Utlagator' &amp; Utlagand'</hi> was plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d betwixt two Clauses, which concerned Felons: And the Reason given is, because <hi>the middle Clause of Outlawry stands perfect of it self, and without dependance upon the other, though it be amongst them:</hi> And by the same Reason, this Clause concerning <hi>Prizage,</hi> ought not to lose any thing of it's force and effect, by its being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as it is; Which I conceive to be a full answer to that Objection.</p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:52142:126"/>
               <p>My <hi>Seventh</hi> Reason is this; <hi>viz.</hi> because the <hi>Priviledge</hi> is annext to the <hi>Goods,</hi> and not to the <hi>Person:</hi> As on the other side has béen agréed, and is evident by <hi>Hanger's Case</hi> afore-cited: And consequently wherever the <hi>Goods of a Citizen</hi> are import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there the <hi>Exemption</hi> takes place: And this appears by the Wording of the <hi>Grant:</hi> It is not said that every <hi>Citizen</hi> shall be <hi>discharged, &amp;c.</hi> but <hi>de Vinis Civium nulla prisa fiat, &amp;c.</hi> so that the force and strength of the Clause rests upon the Word <hi>Vinis,</hi> and the Word <hi>Citizen</hi> is but the Genitive Case to it, and a Word that appropriates the <hi>Wines</hi> to the <hi>Persons,</hi> whose <hi>Wines</hi> were intended to be so exempted. As in the Case, 10 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 8. <hi>a.</hi> If a Man Grant <hi>Custodiam prati &amp; arborum vento prostratarum,</hi> there if the Grantée take any Windfals, he shall account for them: But if the Words had run thus, <hi>viz. Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam prati &amp; arbores vento prostratas,</hi> he should not have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for them. For in the first Case, the effect of the Grant, as to the Trees, depends upon the first Word <hi>Custodiam;</hi> but in the other Case, the Word <hi>Arbores,</hi> being put in the Accusative Case, makes it a separate and distinct Grant. So in our Case, the effectual Word, which governs the Period, and with which the <hi>Priviledge</hi> runs, is the Word <hi>Wines:</hi> And therefore, where the <hi>Wines</hi> described in the <hi>Grant</hi> are found, <hi>viz. the Wines of Citizens,</hi> there the <hi>Exemption</hi> takes place, be it where it will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> The place where <hi>Prizage</hi> shall become due, is but Circumstantial and Accidental, and therefore shall follow and attend the substance; as in the Case <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> 9 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. Where a Man Grants Common <hi>ubicunque averia sua ierint;</hi> there the Grantée may put in his Beasts, when and where he will; because the Grant of <hi>Common</hi> is the Substance, and the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> is not. So here the <hi>Exemption</hi> from the duty of <hi>Prisage</hi> is the Substance, and the <hi>Place</hi> but Circumstantial and Accidental.</p>
               <p>But it has béen objected, that this <hi>Priviledge</hi> has never béen enjoyed, but in the <hi>Port of London,</hi> and that therefore the <hi>Charter</hi> ought to be so construed, as not to extend to <hi>other Ports.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Answer, <hi>First,</hi> That indeed <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Usage,</hi> will in some cases extend an <hi>Ancient Grant,</hi> beyond what the Words in themselves would otherwise import; as in the Case afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, of the Forest of <hi>Savernacle;</hi> in which Case, the Grant was extended by the better Opinion, to carry Tithes not comprized in the <hi>Videlicet.</hi> And so in the 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> in the Case of the <hi>Abbot of Strata Mercella.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:52142:127"/>
               <p>But <hi>Non-user,</hi> will never destroy the validity of a Grant of things, which do not lye in Forfeiture for <hi>Non-user,</hi> which is our Case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I say, if other <hi>Citizens,</hi> or the Defendant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, has at any time or times waived this <hi>Priviledge,</hi> that ought not to turn to their or his prejudice, whenever they or he shall think fit to claim it. For if any Man have a legal Discharge of <hi>Toll, Pontage, Murage, &amp;c.</hi> and shall notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing submit to pay those Duties, he may for all that insist upon his <hi>Priviledge,</hi> when ever he pleases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Perhaps some Persons have chose rather to pay a small sum, than to contend the matter; but that is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that therefore when greater sums are demanded, they ought then to submit in like manner.</p>
               <p>But besides all this, We have it in proof, as far as a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative is capable of being proved, that <hi>Prizage</hi> has not been paid for <hi>Citizens</hi> Goods, though Imported elsewhere, than at the <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The adverse Party rely most upon the Case of the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> who have the like <hi>Priviledge</hi> for their Goods, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which (say they) it was adjudged in <hi>Trinity Term,</hi> 7 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>in Scaccario,</hi> That that <hi>Priviledge</hi> did not extend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> but was Circumscribed within their own Limits.</p>
               <p>To which I Answer, <hi>First,</hi> That if their <hi>Priviledge</hi> be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed within their own Limits. <hi>viz.</hi> those of their own <hi>Ports,</hi> yet they have a larger boundary than the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> whom the Plaintiffs Councel would restrain as to this <hi>Priviledge,</hi> to <hi>Wines</hi> Imported into the <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>London</hi> only, where their Bulks are for the most part broken up: And therefore the Inhabitants of the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> have the more Reason to be Satisfied.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Priviledge</hi> of the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> stands wholly upon another Foundation, than this of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London:</hi> For the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Cinque-Ports</hi> were first Granted to them, as appears by their Ancient <hi>Charters,</hi> which I have seen, by reason of their personal attendance to oppose Foreign Invasions, and in consideration of the Charge that they were at therein, and the Hazard, that they were to run thereby. And to encourage them to be the more diligent in attending upon this Service, were their <hi>Priviledges</hi> Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them: And that is the Reason, why their <hi>Priviledges</hi> do not extend beyond the Limits of the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> from which they ought not to recede. But the <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities</hi> Granted to the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> are upon another
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:52142:127"/> Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> because it is the <hi>Metropolitam City, Cor Regni &amp; Camera Regis,</hi> the Life, source and fountain of all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise and Trade, which furnisheth and supplieth the whole Kingdom with Commodities: And therefore their Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es with respect to Trade, ought in Reason to be as extensive as their Trade it self. Which Reason does not hold in that Case, of the <hi>Cinque Ports:</hi> And therefore the Argument drawn from them, is not conclusive.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude with the Statute of 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is Enacted, That no Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> or other the Kings Subjects, Inhabiting in any other place Exempt from Prizage, shall custome any other Mens Goods in their own Names <hi>in any place,</hi> upon Pain of Forfeiting, double the value of the <hi>Prizage:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">N. B. these words <hi>(in any place)</hi> are not in the Statute.</note> Whereby it appears to have been the Iudgment of that Parliament, that the City of <hi>London</hi> had such a <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> as I contend for. I hope the Court will be of the same Opinion, and give Iudgment for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>A few days after, the <hi>Barons</hi> delivered their Opinions, <hi>seriatim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Turner,</hi> Iudgment ought to be given for the Plaintiff, for I take it that the <hi>Citizens of London,</hi> are not discharged of <hi>Prizage</hi> in the <hi>Out-Ports:</hi> General words in the King's Patents, shall not always be Generally expounded, but do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of many Restrictions, Qualifications and Exceptions, and so do the Grants of Subjects in same Cases: As, if a man Grant to another <hi>omnes Arbores suas,</hi> Fruit Trees do not pass thereby <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the words of this <hi>Grant</hi> should be extended to <hi>All Ports,</hi> it would be a great prejudice to other Merchants. <hi>Thirdly, Prizage</hi> was an <hi>ancient Inheritance in the Crown,</hi> and therefore, shall not pass from the King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>express words. Fourthly,</hi> Because the Clauses in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which are both precedent and subsequent to the Clause in question, and which contain Grants of <hi>Exemption</hi> to the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of London</hi> in other matters, have these express words, <hi>viz. tam extrà quàm infra civitatem proedictam.</hi> And <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Case of the <hi>Cinque Ports,</hi> which has béen cited and insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted on by the Plaintiffs Council, appears to me to be a Case in point. <hi>Wherefore, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Atkyns,</hi> Argued for the Plaintiff too; <hi>First,</hi> Because <hi>nothing that is matter of Prerogative, can pass from the King, without express and determinate words. Hob.</hi> 243. <hi>in Stanhope's Case against the Bishop of Lincoln, Williams and Adamson. Secondly,</hi> By comparing the wording of this Clause, with the wording of the Clauses before and after, it appears not to have béen the <hi>King's</hi> Intention, that it should pass <hi>per totam Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:52142:128"/> Thirdly,</hi> To put such a construction, would tend both to the <hi>King's</hi> dishonour, and to his loss: To his dishonour, by Reason, that so great a number of his other Subjects would receive a prejudice thereby. And to his loss, in respect of his own Revenue, which would be diminished. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because such Patents have béen used to be construed strictly, as appears by <hi>Sacheverill's Case.</hi> And he that enjoys this Priviledge must be <hi>Civis &amp; liber homo,</hi> frée of the City, and an Inhabitant within the City, and a <hi>Pater-familias</hi> too: If he want any of those qualifications, he is not intituled to this <hi>Priviledge;</hi> as was resolved in <hi>Hanger's Case, Moor, Case</hi> 1120. So that this <hi>Grant</hi> has béen expounded <hi>strictly. vid.</hi> 8 <hi>Rep. Jehu Webb's Case,</hi> upon Grants of the like nature. <hi>vid. Sir John Davy's Reports</hi> 7. 8, <hi>&amp;c. le Case de Customs payable pur Merchandises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron</hi> Argued on the same side. <hi>First,</hi> He said this <hi>Priviledge</hi> ought not to be extended to the <hi>Out-Ports,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the King's Grants, Indefinite words do not import an absolute Vniversality, as appears by a Case cited in <hi>Sir John Davy's Reports, p.</hi> 17. <hi>a. viz.</hi> The King had Granted to a <hi>Venetian</hi> Merchant, that he should be quit, <hi>de omnibus Custum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, subsidiis &amp; Impositionibus, &amp; omnibus aliis denariorum summis debitis &amp; solubilibus pro quibuscunque Merchandizis, importand', &amp;c.</hi> and that he should be <hi>as Free as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of London.</hi> By colour of which <hi>Charter,</hi> he claimed to be free of <hi>Prizage,</hi> because by <hi>a Special Charter,</hi> the <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of London</hi> were discharged thereof. And yet it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, that this Grant did not discharge him of <hi>Prizage,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Prizage</hi> is not specially exprest in the Grant. <hi>Vid. etiam</hi> 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. 4. And in our Case, the <hi>Grant</hi> may well be satisfied, without such a General Exposition, as this. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He argued from the nature of the thing Granted, which was an Inheritance in the King, and an antient Revenue of the Crown: And there is a great diversity betwixt Grants made by the King of things which were not vested in himself before, but are as it were created by the Grants made thereof, as Exemption from Toll; and Grants of things, which prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Grants, were actually parcel of the Kings Revenue: In which last Case, special words are required; as appears by the Case in <hi>Sir John Davy</hi> now cited. And it appears by the <hi>Red-book</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> that Grants of Exemption from <hi>Prizage,</hi> made to the Merchants of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and of other forein places, run in these words, <hi>per totum Regnum;</hi> and therefore we may reasonably conclude, that this <hi>Patent,</hi> would have béen conceived in the same words, if the Kings intention had béen such.</p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:52142:128"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He argued from the nature of the place, to which this <hi>Grant</hi> was made; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>City of London,</hi> which has a <hi>Port</hi> of its own of a large extent, and therefore there is no necessity of construing the Patent, so as to discharge them elsewhere. If such a Grant were made to the Town of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> where there is no Port, it were reasonable to allow the discharge to run <hi>per totam Angliam,</hi> because the Grant could not admit of any other Construction. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He considered the manner of the Grant it self; In a Grant made to them by King <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>Prizage</hi> is excepted, but in 1 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. it is remitted to them. And here <hi>First,</hi> the consideration of the Patent is Local, <hi>pro melioratione Civium. Secondly,</hi> The Clauses before and after have Special words, <hi>tam extrà quàm infrà Civitatem.</hi> And for Authorities, it has béen Adjudged in the Case of the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> upon a like Grant with this before us, that they shall not be discharged out of the <hi>Ports.</hi> But if a Ship bound for the Port of <hi>London,</hi> should by stress of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or otherwise be forced into any other <hi>Port,</hi> in such a case as that, the <hi>Citizens</hi> are to enjoy their <hi>Priviledge,</hi> as well as if the Ship had arrived in the <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>London:</hi> And so it was held 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>And accordingly it was <hi>Decreed for the Plaintiff</hi> the same Term.</p>

               <p>But <hi>per Hale Chief Baron &amp; totam Curiam,</hi> the Surmise is not sufficient to award a <hi>Venire facias</hi> to a <hi>forein County. First,</hi> Because it does not appear that the Title will come in
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:52142:129"/> question upon this Issue: For the Defendant may perhaps insist upon some other Title, or that he has not taken the Profits. And in all the Cases that have been cited, as in <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 85. <hi>Day and Savage's Case;</hi> and in <hi>Smith and Hancocke's Case in B.R.</hi> and in the Case of one <hi>Bowbridge,</hi> it appear'd by the Issue that all the County was concern'd; otherwise no <hi>forein Venue</hi> ought to be awarded. And in the Case between <hi>Day and Savage</hi> the Question was, whether the Issue should be tried by <hi>Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate,</hi> or by a <hi>Jury;</hi> and not whether a <hi>Ven. fac'</hi> should issue into a <hi>forein County.</hi> And in the Case of <hi>Smith and Hancocke,</hi> the Defendant in Trespass Iustified by virtue of the <hi>Custom of the City of London;</hi> so that the Cities being concerned in the Cause appeared by the <hi>Issue,</hi> and not by <hi>Surmise, Secondly,</hi> It does not appear by this Surmise that there is not a sufficient number of Fréeholders in the City to try this Issue, who are not Frée of the City, nor within the distress of the City, which ought to appear, for else there shall not go a <hi>Venire</hi> into a <hi>forein County.</hi> And in the case in <hi>Dyer</hi> 279. <hi>b.</hi> concerning the Custom of the City of <hi>York,</hi> that Wares forein bought and foreign sold within the Liberties of the City should be forfeited and seisible by the Mayor, Viscounts and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, the <hi>Venire facias</hi> was awarded to the Sheriff of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> upon a Suggestion, that there was not a sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Freeholders within the City, not free of the City, to try the Issue; as appears by <hi>Bendloe's Rep. Case</hi> 39. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is not here surmised that the <hi>Title</hi> will come in question, but that it may come in question; which is but a <hi>May be.

To whom should a <hi>Venue</hi> be awarded to try it? In all cases of <hi>forein Venires,</hi> they are awarded either by <hi>Admittance</hi> or <hi>Consent of the Parties,</hi> or upon a <hi>Nient dedire,</hi> or a <hi>Demurrer overruled;</hi> as appears <hi>Pl.

In this case the Deliverer, or the Owner, may have an Action against him; but they cannot <hi>Joyn</hi> where the <hi>Consideration</hi> is not <hi>Joynt:</hi> As when in Consideration of Ten Shillings given by two men, a Man assumes to do something to or for them severally, or to or for a Stranger. But if the <hi>Consideration</hi> be <hi>several;</hi> as for Example, in Consideration of Ten shillings paid by one, and Ten Shillings by another; there they must <hi>sever in the Action.</hi> And if a third person be to have the benefit of the Promise, as in the case of Father and Son, where a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is made to the Father for the benefit of the Son, there they cannot Ioyn; but either of them may bring the Action. But in that case the Declaration must be upon a Promise made to the Father, though the Son bring the Action. So if in Consideration of Five Shillings given to the Defendant, he promise to pay so much to one, and so much to another; he to whom the Promise is made may bring the Action, and the breach of Promise and the Consideration given is a sufficient Damage to him. <hi>Per Curiam.</hi>

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:52142:136"/> for the Expounding of that of 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 10.

He held likewise, that the Variances betwixt the former Leases and this in being, both with respect to the <hi>Exceptions</hi> of Tithes, and other things there excepted, which are not excepted here, and in the <hi>Reservation</hi> it self, are material, and sufficient to make <hi>void</hi> the Lease: For in the former Lease before this, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons were <hi>reserved,</hi> and so part of the Rent: Here the Lessee only <hi>Covenants</hi> to pay them, which Covenant of his will not bind his Wife, if she survive him; and therefore his Covenant will not amount to a Reservation. Otherwise, if both had Covenanted; or if the Lease had been made to the Husband alone with such a Covenant. And it was agreed in this case, that a Lease for 21 Years, made of Tithes, is a good Lease within the Statute; but not a Lease for thrée Lives; because Debt lies not for the Rent.

Michael, S James, S. Peter and S. Paul,</hi> and that part of the Premisses ly in the Parish of <hi>S. Peter and S. Paul:</hi> But that there is no Parish called the <hi>Parish of S. Peter,</hi> nor none called the <hi>Parish of S. Paul:</hi> And it was held clearly <hi>per Curiam,</hi> that the <hi>Copulative (Et)</hi> should be referr'd to that which is real and has an Existence, <hi>ut res magis valeat:</hi> Not to make <hi>S. Peter's</hi> one <hi>Parish,</hi> and <hi>S. Paul's</hi> another; but to make them both <hi>one Parish.</hi> And the words <hi>several Parishes,</hi> is supplied by the other Parishes afore-mentioned; so that if there be any such Parish in being, as that of <hi>S. Peter and S. Paul,</hi> the <hi>Copulative</hi> shall refer to that. As in 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Precipe</hi> of Ten Acres in <hi>A.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(7)"/> to shew by what Title he held such a Meadow, which (as was alledged) appertained to the office of Keeper of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Castle,</hi> granted to the Plaintiff for Life; and against the other Defendants, as Brewers of the City of <hi>Glocester,</hi> every one of which, as the Bill suggested, was by Custome obliged to pay such an Annual Sum to the said Officer. To which Bill the Defendants <hi>Demurred:</hi> Because the Bill is concerning things of <hi>several distinct Natures,</hi> and is brought against <hi>several Persons,</hi> which will occasion <hi>several Answers</hi> and <hi>Examinations,</hi> and if they were suffered to be put all into one Bill, each party would be obliged to take Copies of what no way concerned his own Cause; whereby the charge would be encreased to no purpose.

                  <hi>Sir Edward Turner,</hi> for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi> This <hi>Information</hi> is grounded upon a <hi>malum Prohibitum:</hi> And the Question ariseth upon two <hi>Acts of Parliament; viz.</hi> that of 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. and that of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. And I conceive that Iudgment ought to be given against the Defendant: <hi>First,</hi> Because <hi>Licenses</hi> to sell <hi>Wines</hi> are now become part of the Revenue of the Crown, and therefore those Acts ought, in favour of the King,<note place="margin">☞</note> to receive a liberal Construction. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because it is expresly Enacted,<note place="margin">Vid. 7 Ed. 6. c. 5.

                  <hi>That no person or persons whatsoever, &amp;c. shall sell or utter by Retail, &amp;c. any kind of Wine or Wines, to be drunk or spent within his or their Mansion-house or Houses, or other place in his or their tenure or occupation, &amp;c. by any colour, craft, or mean whatsoever.</hi> And where the words of an Act of Parliament are positive and express, no Interpretation ought to be admitted. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To construe a License to kéep a <hi>Tavern,</hi> to be a License to sell Wines by <hi>Retail, to be spent in the person's House,</hi> that has such a License, is against the intention and design of the Acts, which was to prevent mens
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:52142:142"/> disordering themselves by excessive and unreasonable Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The <hi>Preamble</hi> of the <hi>Statute of</hi> 7 <hi>Ed</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 5. mentions <hi>the Inconveniencies, evil Rule and common Resort of mis-ruled persons, used and frequented in many Taverns of late, newly set up, in very great number, in Back-Lanes, Corners, and Suspicious places, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore the <hi>Acts</hi> are to be construed so as to prevent only those Inconveniences: which will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently avoided, though it be allow'd that every man, who has lawful License to kéep a <hi>Tavern,</hi> be <hi>eo ipso</hi> at liberty to sell Wines by <hi>Retail, to be spent in his own House. Resp.</hi> The <hi>Preamble</hi> is but a Key to open the meaning and sense of the Law, but is no Enacting part of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The <hi>Usage</hi> since the making of the <hi>Act</hi> hath been so, that a person's being licenced to keep a <hi>Tavern,</hi> enables him to sell <hi>Wines</hi> in his House by Retail. <hi>Resp. Usage</hi> contrary to an Act of Parliament does not take away the force and effect of the Law. <hi>Besides,</hi> the contrary has béen practised; <hi>vid.</hi> 3 <hi>Eliz.

Also, it was lately held in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> unlawful to <hi>dress Meat</hi> in a Tavern <hi>without Licence;</hi> and so he concluded <hi>pro Quer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hardres</hi> for the <hi>Defendant.</hi> My <hi>first Reason</hi> I take from the <hi>Preamble</hi> of the Act, which shews the Intention of the Law-makers, and gives an Account of the Mischiefs that were before, which appear to have béen occasioned by <hi>Unruly persons fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting Taverns in By-Corners;</hi> so that <hi>Drinking in Taverns</hi> was not the Mischief, but the <hi>Multitude</hi> of Taverns, and their situation in <hi>By Corners:</hi> This the Makers of the Law would have answered, was their design, if they had béen asked the question. But its Objected, That an Enacting Clause in the Statute is express in the point, and from express words <hi>Non est rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum.</hi> I answer; There are Thrée things to be considered in an Act of Parliament: 1. The <hi>Words;</hi> 2. The <hi>Sense</hi> of the Words; 3. The <hi>scope</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of them <hi>taken all together.</hi> As where there are several Clauses in a Déed, the Meaning shall be gathered from them all put together; so as one may not confound nor contradict another. Now according to this ground, the sense and meaning of this Clause in the Act of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:52142:143"/> 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. which is so much urged, will be thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That no person, not having a License according to the Act, shall sell any Wines by Retail; nor any that has a License shall sell Wines by Retail, but only in his Mansion-house, and not elsewhere. And such an Exposition is frequent upon other Statutes; as <hi>Magn. Chart. cap.</hi> 7, <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. and <hi>Co.</hi> upon those Statutes, 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> 17, 18, 24, 25. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Reason of a Law, and the Design of the Law-makers, must be judged of by what has been the constant practice ever since: For, <hi>Usus optimus Magister &amp; Interpres.</hi> Vpon this ground the word <hi>Lands,</hi> in the Statute of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>de Mercatoribus,</hi> extends to <hi>all Hereditaments.</hi> So the word <hi>Feoffment</hi> in the <hi>Stat. of Marlebr. cap.</hi> 6. extends to <hi>all Conveyances, Co. Mag. Chart. p.</hi> 110. So <hi>Co.</hi> 4 <hi>Rep. Slade's Case,</hi> 94. Vse, Custom and Presidents rule all procéedings in Courts. 2 <hi>Rep. fo.</hi> 17. <hi>Lane's Case,</hi> the word <hi>Commisimus</hi> extends to a <hi>Lease.</hi> So here, it having been the Constant practice since the making of the Statute, to sell Wine in Taverns by Retail, to be spent there, that sufficiently demonstrates how this Law is to be Interpreted. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Law be expounded otherwise, the Exposition will be absur'd and incongruous: That he who keeps a Tavern should not utter his Wine to be spent in his House, is against the nature of the thing it self. And to what great purpose would it be to provide that Taverns shall be kept in open places, if the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners must not be permitted to sell their Wines to be spent in their own Houses, but that all must be sent out of Doors. <hi>Vide Stat. Mert. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; Co. ad loc. Vid. etiam</hi> 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I argue from a <hi>Non-user; viz.</hi> because no Information or Popular Action has ever yet been brought for this pretended Offence; and though <hi>Non user</hi> does not abrogate a Law, yet it much enfeebles the strength of it; <hi>vide Mag. Chart. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; Co. ad loc.</hi> And <hi>Stat. Mert. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Lit. Sect.</hi> 108. <hi>&amp; Co. 1st Inst.</hi> 81. where it is said, That <hi>Non-user</hi> of a thing is a great presumption; that the Law will not bear it, and may expound and declare the meaning of a Law. So here, Since none that have had Licenses to kéep Taverns, have ever been punished for selling Wines by <hi>Retail in their Houses,</hi> it is a good Argument to prove, that the Makers of this Law did not intend they should be punished: And so he prayed Iudgment for the <hi>Defendant.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Thurland</hi> for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi> The best way of Expounding an Act is, by taking all the Clauses together. The <hi>Preamble</hi> does not <hi>limit</hi> and <hi>bound</hi> an <hi>Enacting Clause;</hi> but only shews some Causes why the <hi>Act</hi> was made, as in this case it does no more. And I conceive the Defendant is guilty of a breach of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:52142:143"/> this Law; <hi>First,</hi> The words of the Second Clause are an <hi>Universal Negative,</hi> with restringent words, <hi>Not in any Place or House, &amp;c.</hi> and contrary to such full and positive Words <hi>no</hi> Exposition ought to take place. <hi>Obj.</hi> One part of an Act ought not to destroy the other, if they may be made consistent. <hi>Resp.</hi> The first Clause is only, to License men to sell Wines; the second Clause restrains them from selling any in <hi>their own Houses. Obj. Taverns</hi> are not named in the <hi>Second Clause. Resp.</hi> The Reason is, because <hi>Selling Wine</hi> is prohibited, and so <hi>Taverns</hi> are prohibited in effect: <hi>Taverns</hi> and <hi>Wine sellers</hi> are <hi>Convertible;</hi> and the words of the <hi>License</hi> are only, to <hi>sell Wines by Retail.</hi> And where the Words of an Act are doubtful, such an Exposition ought to be made of them, as will best obviate and redress the Mischief. <hi>Vide Co. Lit.</hi> 188. Now one Mischief here is, <hi>Drinking in Taverns,</hi> of which Notice is taken in the Statute of 28 <hi>Edw. of the View of Frank-pledge.</hi> And such Licenses are not favoured in Law, <hi>Vide Dyer</hi> 270, <hi>a. Obj.</hi> The Practice has been contrary. <hi>Resp.</hi> This were a proper Objection, if the Law were in the <hi>Affirmative;</hi> but this Statute runs in the <hi>Negative, Vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Inst.</hi> 115. <hi>a.</hi> As to what has been argued concerning <hi>Presidents,</hi> they are for us: <hi>Vide Dyer</hi> 270, <hi>a.</hi> And 19 <hi>&amp;</hi> 25 <hi>Eliz. Sir Walter Rawleigh's Case,</hi> where <hi>Licenses</hi> have been granted by the King to that effect, <hi>viz.</hi> to sell Wines <hi>in their Houses.</hi> Likewise the Statute of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. is for advancement of the King's Revenue, and ought therefore to have a large and beneficial Construction for the King's Proffit. And the <hi>Proviso</hi> therein does not reach our Case; for it provides only, That <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Towns Corporate</hi> may use and enjoy such Liberties and Privileges,<note place="margin">12 Car. 2. cap. 25. Par. 8.</note> as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have <hi>Lawfully</hi> used and enjoyed, <hi>Vide</hi> 9 <hi>Rep. the Case of the Abbot of Strata Mercella. Ibidem Quicke's Case, amongst the Cases of the Court of Wards.</hi> So he concluded, and prayed Iudgment <hi>pro Quer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ellis</hi> Argued for the <hi>Defendant.</hi> He insisted, That the <hi>Second Enacting-Clause</hi> was put in favour of <hi>Vintners,</hi> and that the meaning of it was no more than this; <hi>viz.</hi> That no others, but only such as were in the former Clause allowed to be Licensed, should sell Wines by Retail. He cited <hi>Pl. Com.</hi> 17. 464, <hi>&amp;</hi> 469. 1 <hi>Instit.</hi> 365. It is Enacted, 1 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>That Keepers of Taverns shall be taken to be within the Statutes made</hi> 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 <hi>Jacob.</hi> 1. against <hi>Tipling in Ale-houses:</hi> Which would have been to no purpose, if they had taken the Law to be against Keepers of Taverns selling any Wine at all, to be spent in their own Houses. And if the Law were, as it is urged for the Plaintiff, then no Traveller upon the Road could
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:52142:144"/> drink a Glass of Wine in his Inn, if the Inn be a Tavern, but must send for it out of his Inn, which is unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Rainsford</hi> Argued <hi>pro Quer'.</hi> He said Three things were to be considered in the Exposition of a Statute; <hi>First,</hi> What the <hi>Common Law</hi> was before the making of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. 2. What the Mischief was, which the Law-makers would redress: And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What Remedy the Law had provided for that End. Now in this case, <hi>First,</hi> It was lawful before the making of this Law, for any Man to sell Wine where he pleased himself. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the <hi>Mischiefs,</hi> sée the <hi>Preamble</hi> of the Statute. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the <hi>Remedy</hi> provided by the Law, see the <hi>Purview;</hi> which consists of two Clauses concerning Vttering of Wines; <hi>First,</hi> The first Clause carries a Restraint upon <hi>Persons that have no Licenses. The Second</hi> Restrains <hi>them that have Licenses:</hi> Sée the Second Clause, <hi>That no person or persons whatsoever, shall sell or utter by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail any kind of Wine or Wines, to be drunk or spent in his or their Mansion-house or Houses, or other place in his or their Tenure or Occupation, &amp;c.</hi> And as in 5 <hi>Co. Edriche's Case,</hi> one Clause in an Act of Parliament, must not abrogate or controll another. And in this Case, the <hi>Second Clause</hi> restrains the selling or spending of Wines by Retail in any <hi>Taverns</hi> for these two Reasons; <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>First Clause</hi> was made against such as should Sell <hi>without Licenses;</hi> so that the <hi>Second Clause</hi> néeded not with respect to them, but was added for them that should have Licenses, to direct how they should sell their Wines, <hi>viz Not in their Mansion-houses, nor, &amp;c. Secondly,</hi> If the <hi>Act</hi> were construed otherwise, this Inconvenience would follow, <hi>viz.</hi> That one and the some person would be subjected to two Penalties for one and the same Offence, by the same Act of Parliament; that is, to the 5 <hi>l.</hi> by virtue of the <hi>First Clause,</hi> and to the 10 <hi>l.</hi> by the <hi>Second Clause;</hi> which it cannot reasonably be supposed that the Parliament ever intended. 'Tis true, in <hi>Dr. Foster's Case,</hi> 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> we méet with such a thing, but the several Penalties there are inflicted by several Acts, not by one and the same Act of Parliament. It has béen Objected, That the Statute of 1 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. concerning <hi>Tipling,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to <hi>Taverns. Resp.</hi> That Clause well may be supposed to have béen inserted in that Act, by reason that Licenses were frequently granted by the King, to Vintners to sell Wine in their Houses. <hi>Obj.</hi> For Taverners not to be permitted to sell Wine in their Houses, is against the Intent of the Law, and of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:52142:144"/> the License it self. <hi>Resp.</hi> To abridge the Power that one had before, is usual, and may be done by the <hi>Common Law;</hi> as if a man makes a Feoffment in Fee, provided that the Feoffee shall not alien to such a one; much more by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Obj.</hi> No man has béen brought into question upon this account; and the Practice has béen so, that <hi>Vintners</hi> have without controll sold <hi>Wine by Retail,</hi> to be spent in their Houses. <hi>Resp.</hi> This does not appear <hi>Judicially</hi> to the Court. And there has béen much alteration in the practice since 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. nor does Vsage destroy the Effect of a Law, though it be against it, <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 81. <hi>Et multitudo errantium non patrocinatur errori.</hi> And now Licenses to sell Wine are become part of the <hi>Revenue of the Crown;</hi> and therefore Constructions upon Acts of Parliament must be favourable with respect to them, 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 3, 12. <hi>Plow. Com</hi> 10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Turner pro Quer'.</hi> He Argued much upon the same grounds. He was of Opinion. That <hi>Vintners,</hi> as well as other <hi>Retailers,</hi> were within the <hi>Second enacting Clause;</hi> and that there was no material difference betwixt them: But that they were <hi>Synonymous</hi> in the intendment of Law. And here the Clause is <hi>Negative,</hi> which enforceth a more violent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. <hi>Vide</hi> 11 <hi>Rep. Magdalen Coll. Case,</hi> he gave the same Answer that <hi>Rainesford</hi> had done, to the <hi>Objection</hi> grounded upon the <hi>Stat. of</hi> 1 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. And to the <hi>Objection</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inconvenience that <hi>Travellers</hi> would be at, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That the Innkéepers might prevent that Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by taking Licenses to vend Wine in their Houses; and concluded, that <hi>Judgment</hi> ought to be given for the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Atkyns pro Defendente,</hi> for these Reasons: <hi>First,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Intent of the Act appears to be, That a Man having a License pursuant to the Act to kéep a Tavern, may by virtue of that License sell Wines to be spent in his House. Now the Intent of an Act must be gathered from all the words of the Act put together. Of this Act there are Four Parts to be considered: <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Title</hi> of the Act. 2. The <hi>Preamble.</hi> 3. The <hi>Purview.</hi> 4. The <hi>Proviso.</hi> The <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Preamble</hi> of the Act, are the Introductory part thereof, and a Key to the Law. <hi>See the three Purviews of the Statute. Secondly,</hi> Before this Act was made, the Law did not look upon it as a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to sell Wine, to be spent in a Tavern; and therefore we have the less reason to believe, that the Makers of this Act de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed any Remedy whereby to prevent that. And yet there were eleven or twelve Acts of Parliament made before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>selling</hi> of Wines, <hi>prices</hi> of Wine, <hi>Impositions</hi>

First,</hi> There are in this Act of Parliament many <hi>Membra incidentia;</hi> which must all be so Expounded, as to be consistent with one another. <hi>Secondly,</hi> General Clauses in the <hi>Purview</hi> of an Act, may restrain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Clauses in the Preamble; but not special and particular words and Clauses, as there are here; <hi>vide Hob.</hi> 182. <hi>Burton &amp; Morrice's Case. Co. Magn. Chart.</hi> 28. <hi>Again,</hi> This <hi>Second Clause</hi> is a distinct Act by it self, and extends only to <hi>Private Houses,</hi> for which no Provision was made before; <hi>vide Plow.

And it is a constant Rule, That upon all Acts of Parliament there must be such a Construction made, as that one Clause may not destroy and frustrate another. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. is taken away by 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. with respect to <hi>Private Houses.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron pro Defendente.</hi> We are to consider in this Case, <hi>First,</hi> That by the <hi>Common Law</hi> any man might kéep a <hi>Tavern,</hi> and sell Wines there without controll; but ill Orders kept in such places were punishable at <hi>Common Law,</hi> as <hi>Nusances:</hi> And that Tavern-keepers used to Retail Wines, to be spent in their own Houses before 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. appears by the Statute of 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>de visu Franci Plegii: Art.</hi> 28. <hi>Of such as continually haunt Taverns, and no Man knoweth whereon they do live;</hi> and by 51 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>de Pritoribus;</hi> and by 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. 24 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. by which Statutes <hi>Prices</hi> of <hi>Wines,</hi> and <hi>Disorders</hi> in <hi>Taverns</hi> are limited and corrected. The Second thing to be considered, is what Alteration the Statute of 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. has made herein. Now this Act, <hi>First,</hi> limits the <hi>Prices</hi> of <hi>Wines. Secondly,</hi> Restrains Persons from <hi>selling Wines:</hi> And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It restrains the Number of <hi>Vintners,</hi> and the Liberty which they had before. And this we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into these Parts: <hi>First,</hi> Who they are that are allowed to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:52142:145"/> keep a Tavern out of a Corporation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Who are allowed so to do within a Corporation; and the Penalties upon others not allowed by the Act. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Restraint within Market Towns, which is double, according as they are Corporate or not Corporate. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> How they shall be Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> What Numbers shall be Licensed. <hi>For these things Vide the Statute at large.</hi> Now the Clause upon which the Question here ariseth, has a <hi>Saving</hi> annexed to it, and the Statute of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. hath <hi>Two Savings; See them in the Statute.</hi> So that <hi>Two Points</hi> arise hereupon: <hi>First,</hi> Whether or no, before the Statute of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. selling of Wine in a man's own House might be licensed; and how? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether or no there be here such a License, as the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? 'Tis observable in the first place, that every <hi>Taverner</hi> might lawfully <hi>Retail</hi> Wines; but that every <hi>Retailer</hi> of Wines might not keep a <hi>Tavern. Secondly,</hi> That every <hi>Tavern</hi> is a <hi>House,</hi> but not <hi>vice versâ.</hi> A <hi>Taverner</hi> may lawfully <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail</hi> Wines to be <hi>spent in his House</hi> by the Statute of 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. for these Reasons: <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Preamble,</hi> which introduceth the sense and meaning of the Statute, expresseth the Mischief that was before, and which was intended to be Redressed; and the Case in question is not within the Mischief. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Clause which creates a Question in this case, is to be understood of Retailing Wines in <hi>Private Houses,</hi> which are <hi>not Taverns. Thirdly,</hi> The Reason of <hi>Carter's Case,</hi> cited 8 <hi>Rep. in Denham's Case,</hi> extends to our Case; to wit, that a General Clause shall not be stretch'd to particulars menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The word <hi>House</hi> in the Statute, is to understood of <hi>Private Houses;</hi> and to such only does the Act of 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. extend. He that has a <hi>License</hi> to kéep a <hi>Tavern,</hi> has liberty to <hi>Retail</hi> Wines to be spent <hi>in his Tavern:</hi> And the words, <hi>Colour, Craft, Engin, or other Means,</hi> are to be taken <hi>in malam partem,</hi> and must not be applyed to them that have <hi>Licenses</hi> according to the Act. <hi>Object.</hi> This Second Clause extends to all persons whatsoever, or else a man shall be liable to a double penalty for one and the same Offence. <hi>Resp.</hi> Rather we ought to infer, that General words may be restrained by Particular words going before: <hi>Vide</hi> 8 <hi>Rep. Dr. Bonham's Case,</hi> in like case of a Penalty. And the true meaning of the Act was, that no person should sell Wines out of a Market Town, under the penalty of <hi>Ten Pounds;</hi> nor within a Market-Town, under the penalty of <hi>Five Pounds;</hi> nor in a Private House, under the penalty of <hi>Ten Pounds,</hi> whether within or without a Market-Town. And a Man may <hi>Retail</hi> Wines without kéeping a <hi>Tavern;</hi> but not <hi>è contra.</hi> The <hi>Second Question,</hi>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:52142:146"/> which is the more difficult of the two, is, whether or no the <hi>License</hi> in this Case of ours, be a sufficient License to exempt the Defendant from the penalty of the Law? For the <hi>License</hi> is only to <hi>Retail Wines,</hi> and not to kéep a <hi>Tavern:</hi> which must be kept in a certain place. And I am apt to think that this <hi>License,</hi> being only to <hi>Retail,</hi> is not sufficient; but this I will consider further of. because it has not yet been spoke to.</p>
               <p>And upon this last point <hi>Judgment</hi> was <hi>Arrested, quousque, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Court</hi> directed to have it argued, whether or no upon the <hi>Special Verdict</hi> a <hi>Sufficient License</hi> were found to kéep a <hi>Tavern;</hi> for if there be not, then the Defendant is within the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Clause</hi> of the Act of 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. being only a <hi>Retailer</hi> of Wines, and so not qualified to utter VVines to be <hi>spent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serjant Maynard pro quer'.</hi> But he mistook the Point, and Argued that a <hi>Taverner</hi> could not sell <hi>Wines</hi> to be spent in his House; and that a <hi>Taverner</hi> and a <hi>Retailer</hi> were one and the same. But because the Court had already delivered their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and directed one single Point to be Argued, which he had not prepared himself to Argue, he desisted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hardres pro Defendente.</hi> I conceive that upon the <hi>Special Verdict</hi> taken all together, there appears sufficient matter to enable the Defendant to kéep a <hi>Tavern. First,</hi> The Iury find expressly that the Defendant was appointed by the Mayor, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Comminalty of <hi>York,</hi> by <hi>Writing</hi> to kéep a <hi>Tavern</hi> within the said City, and that the Defendant's Tavern was one of the 8 <hi>Taverns,</hi> appointed and Authorized by the <hi>Stat. of</hi> 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. to be kept within the City of <hi>York,</hi> and to sell Wines by <hi>Retail</hi> there, from the day of the date of the said Writing for a Year: Which Writing they find <hi>in haec verba, Know all Men, &amp;c.</hi> by which Writing the Defendant has License given him to <hi>Retail Wines,</hi> but not in express words to kéep a <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.</hi> They find moreover, that by the Colour of this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the Defendant (who had no other License) sold Wines to be drunk in his House. So that upon the whole matter, the Iury find that the Defendant was Licensed to kéep a <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</hi> and kept a <hi>Tavern</hi> accordingly; which being matter of Fact only, the Iury are Iudges of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I take it for a ground, that if a Iury find some <hi>General</hi> matter directly and positively, and afterward find some <hi>Special</hi> matter, the Court in such a case, ought so to apply rhe Special matter, as to make it consistent with the General matter, if it may be. <hi>v.</hi> 6 <hi>Rept. Dowdale's Case.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:52142:146"/>
               <p>So in the 9 <hi>Rept.</hi> in the <hi>Earl of Shrewsbury's Case, fol.</hi> 51. <hi>b.</hi> In an Action upon the Case for holding a Court, and taking the proffitts of it, the Defendant pleaded <hi>Not-Guilty:</hi> The Iury found that from such a day the Defendant held the Court, <hi>us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que impetrationem brevis, &amp; semper abinde recepit proficua, &amp;c.</hi> and the Court held that this last <hi>abinde</hi> shall be understood, to reach only to the Purchase of the Writ; because else it would make void the <hi>Verdict,</hi> if it took in all the time, to the time of the <hi>Verdict</hi> And consequently, Dammages given for all that time. So here this form of the License, may include a power to the Defendant to kéep a <hi>Tavern,</hi> because every Taverner is a Retailer of Wines, tho' every Retailer of Wines, is not a Taverner: And the Iury have found, that the Defendant was hereby Licensed to kéep a Tavern. And if the License be so Vnderstood, all the parts of the Verdict will stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But true it is, that if the Special part of a Verdict contradict the General part, then the Special part only shall stand, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Eliz. Dyer,</hi> 361. in Debt against Executors, the Issue was upon <hi>Assetts enter maines;</hi> and the Iury found a Special Verdict, <hi>scil.</hi> that the Testator made a Leafe for years of a House, and certain Implements therein, rendring Rent to him, his Heirs and Assigns, and that the Executor had received the Rent ever since the Testators Death, <hi>&amp; issint Assettes.</hi> Yet the Court Over-ruled the Conclusion of Assets, because by the Special finding no Assets appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I conceive the Words of this <hi>License</hi> will amount to enable the Defendant to keep a <hi>Tavern. First,</hi> Because in the License that is found, the Defendant is called a <hi>Vintner:</hi> And therefore it is to be presumed, That the Licensers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to give him leave to follow his Trade. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It appears by the Verdict, that by <hi>vertue of the License</hi> he kept a <hi>Tavern,</hi> and that his was one of the <hi>eight Taverns</hi> in <hi>York:</hi> And therefore it is to be presumed, that the Licence was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on purpose to enable him so to do, as in 5 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 1. a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to <hi>Enter and Occupy</hi> amounts to a <hi>Lease,</hi> and ought to be pleaded so. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A <hi>License</hi> ought to be taken most <hi>strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> against him that Grants it, and for his Advantage, to whom it is Granted. As in 13 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 13. A Warrant for a Buck in a Park, impowers the Servant of him that is to have the Buck, to go into the Park for him, and to Assist the Park-Kéeper in killing him, and to bring him away. So 13 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 13. in the <hi>Dutchess of Suffolk's</hi> Case: A License given to me to take Wood, and carry it with a Cart over another Man's Ground, extends to my Servants; because it
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:52142:147"/> is matter of profit. Otherwise, if it were matter of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure only, as to walk in my Garden. And in this Case, the best intendment for the Defendant is, that he be hereby ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to kéep a <hi>Tavern;</hi> for the License can be of no better use to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection,</hi> The Statute mentions two sorts of sellers of Wine, <hi>viz. Retailers</hi> and <hi>Taverners:</hi> And Licenses to kéep a <hi>Tavern,</hi> have usually the word <hi>Tavern</hi> in them. <hi>Resp.</hi> Yet Taverners are the chief Retailers: And therefore the Word Retail shall have such a construction, as will carry the most effectual and beneficial sense: And though Licenses to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verners have those words usually, yet they are not of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, but are <hi>forma loquendi</hi> only. And so he concluded <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>per Hale Chief Baron, &amp; totam Curiam,</hi> there is <hi>not a sufficient License</hi> found here to kéep a <hi>Tavern. First, Tavern-keeping</hi> and <hi>Retailing of Wines,</hi> are things of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from one another. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They have distinct Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given them in the Statute, and distinct penalties are inflicted. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If <hi>Taverners</hi> and <hi>Retailers</hi> of Wine were all one, the design of the Act would be disappointed, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their number, and the places in which they Live: For <hi>Retailers</hi> are not restrained to any certain place or numbers, as <hi>Tavern-keepers</hi> are. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because the Custom has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways béen, that when a man had a License to kéep a <hi>Tavern,</hi> the word <hi>Tavern</hi> was expressed in the License. And although the Defendant be stiled a <hi>Vintner,</hi> that is in a second License, not in the first, upon which the Verdict is given for 5 <hi>l. penalty:</hi> And though it be found that he kept one of the 8 <hi>Taverns,</hi> yet no License is found enabling him so to do.</p>
               <p>So upon this point, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>want of a sufficient License</hi> in this behalf, <hi>Judgment</hi> was given <hi>against the Defendant.</hi>

               <p>IN an <hi>Action upon the Case,</hi> against the <hi>Farmers of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(2)"/> Customs,</hi> for taking more for Custom than they ought, the question was singly this; <hi>viz.</hi> By the <hi>Book of Rates,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Act of <hi>Tunnage and Poundage</hi> five pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi> are allowed to the Merchants out of the subsidy of <hi>Poundage,</hi> and 10 <hi>l.</hi> more for ready Mony: And whereas twelve pence in the pound is due and payable to the King for <hi>Poundage,</hi> six pence in the pound more is given by another Act, and called the <hi>Additional Duty:</hi> And whether or no five pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi> should be allowed out of this <hi>Additional Duty</hi> or not, was the <hi>Question?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Robert Atkyns</hi> argued <hi>proQuer'. First,</hi> From the Title of the <hi>Book of Rates,</hi> which mentions the <hi>benefit of Merchants, &amp;c. Secondly,</hi> From the Generality of the Clause, whereby the five pounds are allowed, <hi>viz. of all Subsidies:</hi> And the <hi>Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Duty</hi> is part of the <hi>Subsidy. Thirdly,</hi> This <hi>Additional Duty</hi> is of the same kind and nature, to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses with the original Subsidy of twelve pence in the pound. And the same Book allows it for <hi>Wines,</hi> and yet there is an <hi>Additional Duty</hi> upon them, and called so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stevens pro Defendente.</hi> This <hi>Additional Duty</hi> is distinct from the <hi>Subsidy,</hi> because otherwise denominated; and a special al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance being made to the Merchants out of the Subsidy, that cuts off all other allowances, unless they were directed by special words; as where in Case of <hi>leakage</hi> 12 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> is allowed, that cuts off all other Allowances: And so he thought the Act in this Case ought to be interpreted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> If the <hi>Subsidy</hi> of twelve pence in the pound and the <hi>Additional Dury</hi> of six pence, had béen both of them in one and the same Act of Parliament, there had then béen no doubt in the Case, but that the <hi>Allowance</hi> of 5 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> should have béen made out of both. And as it is, it is upon the matter but one <hi>Entire Subsidy</hi> of 1 <hi>Shilling and six pence</hi> in the pound: <hi>sed Adjurnatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Trinity Term</hi> after the Iudges delivered their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>seriatim. Baron Rainesford</hi> was of Opinion, that 5 <hi>l.</hi> ought not to be allow'd out of the Additional Duty, but only out of the twelve pence in the pound: He said, <hi>First,</hi> This <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Duty</hi> was given in lieu of the <hi>Excise,</hi> out of which no such allowance was made. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in the Statute of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:52142:148"/>
                  <hi>Tunnage and Poundage fol.</hi> 4. the <hi>Subsidy</hi> is described, and it's description does not agrée with the <hi>Additional Duty. Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Books of Rates</hi> makes a distinction-betwixt these two Duties; as appears by the <hi>second Rule</hi> and <hi>twelfth Rule,</hi> by the different names given them, and different times appointed for payment. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because the 10 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> allowed for present payment, is an allowance which depends upon the Merchant's Election; and that shews it to be different from the <hi>Subsidy of twelve pence, &amp;c. Object.</hi> The <hi>Seventeenth Rule</hi> is General; <hi>viz. Out of all Subsidies. Resp.</hi> But this Duty of <hi>six pence per pound</hi> is not the <hi>Subsidy,</hi> nor any part of it; and it has <hi>Allowance</hi> peculiar to it self. <hi>Object.</hi> The Title of the Rules mentions the benefit of Merchants. <hi>Resp.</hi> The Preamble of the Act mentions <hi>Tunnage and Poundage,</hi> to be given to the King for the defence of the Sea, which is Vniversally for the good of <hi>all Trade. Object.</hi> But Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have this allowance made them. <hi>Resp.</hi> Because they pay more than Englishmen. <hi>Object.</hi> This allowan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> has been made by the Commissioners of the Customs. <hi>Resp.</hi> Neither the King nor the Farmers are concluded by their allowing it, if it were not due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Turner, Baron Atkyns and Hale Chief Baron</hi> argued all <hi>pro Quer',</hi> that 5 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> ought to be allowed out of the <hi>Additional Duty,</hi> as well as out of the <hi>twelve pence per pound. First,</hi> It appears in divers places of the <hi>Book of Rates,</hi> that <hi>six pence in the pound,</hi> is look't upon as part of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidy</hi> of <hi>Poundage;</hi> and then 5 <hi>l.</hi> being by the <hi>Seventeenth Rule,</hi> to be allowed out of <hi>all Subsidies,</hi> must be allowed out of that. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is in reality a <hi>Subsidy</hi> of <hi>Poundage,</hi> because paid by the <hi>pound. Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Book of Rates</hi> is incorporated into the Act of Parliament, and is part of it; so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is there, is to be taken as if compriz'd in the body of the Act it self. It's <hi>Objected,</hi> that this Duty comes in liew of the <hi>Ekcise Resp.</hi> That does not appear to us: But if it be so, it's now converted into a Duty of another Nature. <hi>Obj.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Allowances are directed to be made out of this Duty; <hi>viz.</hi> 10 <hi>l. per Cent. Resp.</hi> That Allowance is only for Interest, in respect of present payment. <hi>Obj.</hi> It's called by another name. <hi>Resp.</hi> The word <hi>Additional</hi> shews it to be a Subsidy, and of the same nature with the <hi>twelve pence in the pound.</hi> In the Act of <hi>Tunnage and Poundage, Paragr.</hi> 13. the sum of 3 <hi>l.</hi> and 4 <hi>l.</hi> a Tun <hi>Additional Duty</hi> is given and so called. <hi>Object.</hi> By the second Rule a moity of the <hi>twelve pence in the pound,</hi> is to be allowed in case the same Merchandizes be exported again, and the Whole <hi>Additional Duty. Resp.</hi> That is only
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:52142:148"/> in one particular Case, which does not alter the Nature of the Duty. And Iudgment was given <hi>pro Quer', nisi, &amp;c.</hi>

For the <hi>first,</hi> he held it to be a good Office: That in many Cases the King might create an Office <hi>de novo,</hi> by the Words <hi>Constituimus, Erigimus;</hi> but this Office seemed by the Statute of 43 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 12. to be an Office <hi>by Prescription.</hi> Yet if it were but an Office in <hi>Reputation;</hi> and mentioned as an Office in <hi>Patents</hi> and <hi>Grants,</hi> that were sufficient, without words of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, <hi>Erigimus &amp; Constituimus, &amp;c. Vide</hi> 12 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. 79. in case of a Grant of the Office of <hi>Brocage.</hi> Also in this case, the Grant of an Office, and the Appointing of an Officer is good without <hi>Constituimus, Erigimus, &amp;c.</hi> because it was an Employment in being before: As in case of a <hi>Warenner</hi> or <hi>Parker. Vide</hi> 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 79. Also if an Officer be constituted by Grant, it is sufficient, although there be no Office erected by express words, as appears 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>b.</hi> If the King Grant to a Man the Office of House-kéeper, with a Fée for exercising it, it's a good Grant though there were no such Office before; <hi>Dyer</hi> 200. <hi>b.</hi> And that an Office <hi>de novo</hi> may be Erected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Words <hi>Erigimus, Constituimus, &amp;c.</hi> appears by <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and Burnet's Case, Mich.</hi> 1651. <hi>B.R. Enter, H. and Field and Boothby's Case, in</hi> 1658 <hi>B. R. Enter Pasch.</hi> 1657. <hi>Rot.</hi> 474. Grant of the Office of House-kéeper, good by the word <hi>Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus. Object.</hi> Here's no fée Granted. <hi>Resp.</hi> It's Granted that the Fée shall be ascertained by the Mayor of <hi>London.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, a Fée is not of necessity, <hi>Vide Moor p.</hi> 808, 809. <hi>the Bishop of Salisbury's Case;</hi> where it is held, that the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a New Office and Officer is good in Law though no Fée, neither Annual nor Casual were annexed to it at first. For the <hi>Second Point;</hi> he held it to be an Office of Trust. Those are Offices of Trust, which concern the Common-Weal, the King's Revenues, the Administration of Iustice,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:52142:149"/> and the Subjects in General. Now this Office concerns <hi>First,</hi> the King's Revenues with respect to the Customs, as appears by the Preamble of the Act of 43 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 12. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Subjects interest and benefit; <hi>viz. All Merchants.</hi> And therefore he held, as to the <hi>third Point,</hi> that it was not Grantable for years, no more than the Office of Marshal of the King's Bench, <hi>Vide</hi> 9 <hi>Rep. Sir George Reynel's Case, &amp; les reasons la done. Cr.</hi> 1. <hi>Rep.</hi> 584. <hi>Bro. Office,</hi> 45. So he concluded for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Symson pro Defendente.</hi> He argued, that it was an Office Grantable for years. <hi>First,</hi> The Right of Granting and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting <hi>New Offices</hi> is Vested in the <hi>King,</hi> as the Head and Fountain of Iustice: What Grants are void in such Cases, <hi>Vide Nat. Br.</hi> 222. 13 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Dyer</hi> 51. and for the Nature of an Office of Trust, <hi>Vide Co. Lit. fol.</hi> 3. <hi>b.</hi> But <hi>Sir George Reynel's Case.</hi> 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> is Objected. <hi>Resp.</hi> There is a Condition in Law annexed to <hi>Offices,</hi> by which they become forfeitable through <hi>Misuser, Abuser</hi> and <hi>Non-user:</hi> From which an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer may be given, to all that is urged from <hi>Sir George Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel's Case,</hi> 9th <hi>Rep. Vide Pl. Com.</hi> 380. that where there is trust and confidence reposed in an Officer, such Officer cannot make a Deputy, unless he be impowred by express words so to do. 9 <hi>Rep. the Earl of Shrewsbury's Case, and the Lady Russel's Case.</hi> A Deputy may be made, where an Office is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of to a Person, that is uncapable to manage it in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <hi>Vide Pl. Com.</hi> 381. that a Woman may be endow'd of an Office. But the true and ancient diversity, is betwixt Officers <hi>Judicial</hi> and <hi>Ministerial. Cro.</hi> 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 276, 556. <hi>Object.</hi> if this <hi>Office</hi> be allowed to be Grantable <hi>for years,</hi> then it may be forfeited for <hi>Outlawry. Resp.</hi> That will not follow: For the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing may exempt it. <hi>Vide Dyer,</hi> 2. <hi>Pl. Com.</hi> 380. An Annuity <hi>pro Consilio impendendo</hi> not forfeitable. In the 9 <hi>Rep. in Sir George Reynel's Case,</hi> the Custom of the Court was urged, which is not in our Case. And the consequence of not allowing this Office to be Grantable <hi>for Years,</hi> will be considerable. In 6 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. the Office of <hi>Printing</hi> was Granted to <hi>Barker and Bill</hi> for <hi>Years:</hi> And it was held to be a good Grant by <hi>Justice Jones</hi> and <hi>Doderidge,</hi> upon a reference to them from the Council-Table. And the same Objections were made there that are here. And one Reason given by them was, because it was but an <hi>Imployment.</hi> And no more is ours. So the Office of <hi>Post-Master</hi> was Granted to the Lord <hi>Stanhope</hi> for <hi>Years,</hi> and held to be good. Wherefore, he prayed Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> The Office of <hi>Garbler</hi> has been held not Grantable <hi>for years,</hi> but that such a Grant amounts to an <hi>Appointment;</hi> as was held in the Case betwixt the <hi>City of London and Hatton.</hi> Employments of <hi>Private Concern,</hi> as that of a <hi>House-keeper,</hi> are grantable for <hi>years;</hi> otherwise of <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> that are of a <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>general Concern.

               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Rainesford pro Defendente. First,</hi> I will consider how the Law would have béen in this case, before the making of the Statute of 43 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 12. concerning <hi>Policies of Assurances. Secondly,</hi> How the case stands upon the <hi>Statute:</hi> And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How the Law is since the <hi>Statute</hi> in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He said, the Patent under which the Plaintiff claims this Office, would before the Statute have been a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> and void, nor could it have bound or charged the Subject, <hi>Vid. Co. pla. Cor.</hi> 187. 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 86. <hi>b.</hi> 13 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 14, <hi>b.</hi> Before the Statute a man had no Benefit by Entring his Policy, nor is any Fee allowed by the Plaintiff's Patent, nor is it found that the Major of <hi>London</hi> has setled any according to the Statute: So that the taking of a Fee is but an <hi>Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</hi> And therefore the Plaintiff having no right to take it himself, cannot have an Action against another for taking it. Besides, the Grant of the <hi>Office</hi> by the word <hi>Commisimus</hi> is void, because there was no such <hi>Office</hi> before; as in the Case of <hi>Brocage,</hi> 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 79. <hi>Mo. Rep.</hi> 880. there ought to have béen the words <hi>Erigimus, &amp; Constituimus.</hi> Also, if the King had Granted it with a Fee, it would have been void, because the King cannot charge the Subject. And it is not found, that any Fees have been appointed according to the Statute. <hi>Vide Co.</hi> 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 89. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9 <hi>Rep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Office</hi> by the Statute is only an <hi>Office</hi> for <hi>Registring Polices of Assurance,</hi> and does not extend to the <hi>Making</hi> of them. And Fees void by Law are not made good by the Statute, which gives only Power to the Mayor and others, to settle Fees, and that does not appear to have been done: I take the Plaintiff's Grant to be so far good, as to Enable him to Register, but not to take a Fee for it. <hi>Object.</hi> If it be void as to one, it is void as to both. <hi>Vide</hi> 11 <hi>Rep. Auditor Curle's Case. Resp.</hi> That was a <hi>Judicial Office,</hi> which ours is not: And a Grant may be good for an <hi>Office,</hi> though not for <hi>Fees.</hi> As a Grant of the <hi>Letter Office</hi> with a Fee, has been held void as to the Fee only, and with respect to a Subject, but good against the King. As a fraudulent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:52142:150"/> may be good against one man, and void as to another. And if no Fee be due, then No Action lies for the Plaintiff here: <hi>Vide</hi> 8 <hi>Rep. Jehu Webbe's Case;</hi> because the <hi>Office</hi> is a Charge without Profit. <hi>Et per</hi> 30 <hi>Ass. pl.</hi> 4. there is a diversity between an <hi>Ancient</hi> and a <hi>New Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Plaintiff here has no <hi>certain Fee</hi> for Executing the <hi>Office,</hi> and therefore can have no Action: For the <hi>Fees</hi> ought to appear what they are, that so the Court may judge whether they be <hi>reasonable</hi> or not, 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 86, <hi>b.</hi> 30 <hi>Ass.</hi> 4. Nor does it appear what <hi>Fees</hi> others have received before: <hi>Vide Mo. Rep.</hi> 474. <hi>Heddy &amp; Welhouse's Case.</hi> that the <hi>Fee</hi> must be reasonable: And that the Court may adjudge whether it be or no; <hi>Vide the Bishop of Chester's Case, cited</hi> 10 <hi>Rep. in the Bishop of Salisbury's Case:</hi> As in case of <hi>Fines</hi> for a <hi>Copyhold,</hi> where they are uncertain, else the Subject may be oppressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Grant of this Office <hi>for years</hi> is a good Grant, for it is <hi>New Office: Ancient</hi> Offices must be granted no otherwise than they have <hi>acustomably</hi> been granted: Grants of <hi>New Offices</hi> are not restrained by <hi>Usage. Object.</hi> 9th <hi>Rep. Sir George Reynel's Case,</hi> 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 587. <hi>Resp.</hi> This Case differs from that; <hi>First,</hi> That was an <hi>Ancient</hi> Office, ours is not. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was an Office belonging to a <hi>Court</hi> in <hi>Westminster-Hall;</hi> so is not ours. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Officer there was to be admitted by the Court; not so here. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and great care is requisite to the management of that Office; this Office requires very little. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That is an Office that requires skill, so does not this. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Reasons that are given in that case, why that Office could not by Law be granted for years, do not reach this case. <hi>Vide</hi> 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
               <p>There are many Presidents of Offices granted <hi>for years: First,</hi> Offices in which the safety of the Realm is concernd; as the Office of <hi>Havener; i. e. Warden of a Haven</hi> or <hi>Port,</hi> by <hi>R. Hen.</hi> 6. The Office of <hi>Gun-Founder,</hi> 1 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Making Gunpowder,</hi> by the <hi>Now King. Secondly,</hi> Offices that concern the trade of the Realm, 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Exchange of Mony, 18 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Gager. 17 <hi>R.</hi> 2. of Aulnager. 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 24. and the Letter-Office <hi>temp. Car.</hi> 1. 3. Offices that concern Administration of Iustice, as that of <hi>Coroner</hi> and <hi>Sheriff,</hi> till the 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 7. of Surveyor of the Green-wax, and of the 6 <hi>d.</hi> Writs in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and Subpena's in <hi>C. B.</hi> and <hi>B. R.</hi> of Controller of Sealing Writs, of making out Process in <hi>C. B.</hi> and in 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> 47. Of the Stewardship of a Court. And if the Grant of this Office for years should be adjudged void, it would go near to shake all these Grants.</p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:52142:150"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Turner</hi> argued for the <hi>Defendant:</hi> He cited <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 153. that a Ministerial Office may well be granted for years, and 11 <hi>Rep. Auditor Curle's Case;</hi> and denyed that the Reason of <hi>Sir George Reynel's Case</hi> 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> could be applied to this. But whereas it had been <hi>Objected</hi> that the Plaintiff did not set forth a <hi>Title</hi> to the Office, he said that in an <hi>Assize</hi> that would have been necessary, but not in an <hi>Action upon the Case Vide</hi> 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Avowry</hi> 43. 34 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 43. <hi>Cro.</hi> 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 500. 338. It had likewise been <hi>Objected,</hi> that the Plaintiff did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how he was disturbed, as he ought <hi>per</hi> 8 <hi>Rep. France's Case. Resp.</hi> It is found that he kept in the House, and that is a sufficient disturbance. But he concluded <hi>pro Def.</hi> upon the validity of the Grant <hi>for years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Atkyns pro Defendente.</hi> He argued much as <hi>Baron Rainesford</hi> had done, and insisted upon the multitude of Offices granted <hi>for years;</hi> and quoted <hi>Slade's Case,</hi> 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> that <hi>Presidents</hi> make a Law, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> The Question here ariseth upon a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Grant <hi>for years</hi> made to him, under whom the Defendant claims, and a latter Grant made <hi>for life</hi> to the Plaintiff of the Office of <hi>Registring Polices of Assurances;</hi> and I think Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be given for the Defendant. I hold the Office in question to be a <hi>good Office,</hi> and that the Plaintiff's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is a good Declaration; but the Defendant has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a better title, for it is ancienter and therefore better, though his Grant be but for years. There is no Office of making Polices, for neither the Common Law, nor the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, warrants the erecting any such Office. Nor is this an Office by <hi>Prescription.</hi> Nor was it well created by Patent in the 17th <hi>year</hi> of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> (for then was the first Grant;) but the Validity of it depends upon the <hi>Accession</hi> of the <hi>Statute of</hi> 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> The Patent is void for making <hi>Polices:</hi> Nor has it any Validity, but what it derives from 43 <hi>Eliz.;</hi> and that Statute mentions only <hi>Entring</hi> of them, and as to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular gives Validity to the Letters Patents of 17 <hi>Eliz.</hi> And there is no Imposition here upon the Subject; and the Grant is good, because the Office is not limited to another person, but is incident to the Commission granted by the King before the Statute, and the Statute takes notice of the Grant. <hi>Vide the Statute. Object.</hi> There is no <hi>Office</hi> at all in the case, because no <hi>Fee</hi> limited. <hi>Resp.</hi> Though there be no certain Fée, yet the party must have what he reasonably deserves, as every one must, that does any thing for another at his Request. Now the Policies must be entred by the Statute of 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:52142:151"/> and the Law will allow a reasonable matter for Entring them: And Vsage since the Statute hath now settled it, if not as a Fée, yet as a competent recompence for his labour; as Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Rates, though certain, yet are not Fees, but <hi>Quantum meruits:</hi> And there may be an Office without a Fée, if the Officer have any other Equivalent profit, <hi>Mo. Rep.</hi> 808. Here is a settled Employment, which the party undertakes for a profit, and for which profit he may have a <hi>Quantum meruit:</hi> And if it be not in strictness of Law an Office, yet it is a Profitable Labour and Employment, and so is valuable. And tho' a man have an Office without a Fée, as the Office of a <hi>Baily</hi> or <hi>Steward,</hi> though the Grantor may turn out such an Officer, yet a Stranger cannot: Nor can the Grantor turn him out, if there are Casual profits incident thereunto; and if a Fée belongs to it, though he turns him out, he must pay him his Fée, 31 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Dr. Grants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Plaintiff here has made a title good enough in his Declaration. <hi>First,</hi> Here is no <hi>Monopoly;</hi> for the Office is erected by 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and though the Grant be void in part, that will not vitiate the whole; as in the Case of the <hi>Letter-Office</hi> afore-cited, and in <hi>Sir Daniel Norton's Case, Hob. Rep.</hi> 12, 13. in case of Covenants betwixt a Sheriff and his Vnder-Sheriff. This Office being an Office by the Statute of 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> a Grant of it by the word <hi>Concessimus</hi> is sufficient. And as to that I take these Distinctions; <hi>viz. First,</hi> If an Office be <hi>relative</hi> to some other thing, there the word <hi>Concessimus</hi> is enough; as the Office of <hi>Parker, Keeper of an House, &amp;c.</hi> those Offices have a relation to the <hi>Park, the House, &amp;c.</hi> which are things in <hi>Being,</hi> and the Offices virtually contained in them; as <hi>Cremer and Burnett's Case in B.R. Vid. Style's Rep.</hi> But the Law is otherwise in case of a <hi>New Office,</hi> conversant about a thing that had no Existence before; as 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 78. 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 17. for in such case the word <hi>Constituimus</hi> is requisite. <hi>Object.</hi> This is not the Grant of the <hi>Office,</hi> but of the <hi>Officer. Resp.</hi> Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Grants of this nature are Grants of the <hi>Office;</hi> but if, it appear sufficiently, as here it does, what the Employment is the Grant will hold. But if his Employment do not appear, the Grant is void, 8 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>Bull and Caesar's Case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Plaintiff had done enough in laying a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance in the Defendant, though he made himself no title; and as to this the Difference is betwixt a <hi>Pernor</hi> of a Rent or other Profit, and the <hi>Terre-Tenant</hi> himself; the Right Owner needs not alledge a title against the former; but against the latter he must, if it be in a Real Action, <hi>vid.</hi> 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 11. for he does not claim the Rent, but disputes the payment of it. But
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:52142:151"/> in a <hi>Personal Action,</hi> as our case is, the Law is the same in both cases. <hi>Cro.</hi> 2 <hi>Rep. Dent's Case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Here the Title appears upon the whole Matter to be for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> because his Grant is <hi>prior</hi> to the other; and it is good, though it be but <hi>for years: First,</hi> Because where a Greater Estate may be granted, there regularly a Lesser Estate may, unless there be some special Reason to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: And if this Office may be granted for <hi>life,</hi> in <hi>tail</hi> or in <hi>fee,</hi> it may be granted for <hi>years:</hi> And it is not universally true, that Offices cannot be Granted <hi>for years,</hi> for some can and are so granted. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is not an <hi>Ancient Office,</hi> but one Erected <hi>de Novo. Thirdly,</hi> It is not of the Nature of this Office to be granted one way or other; as in 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Clerk of the Crown.</hi> And <hi>Custom</hi> makes a <hi>Law</hi> in such cases, <hi>vid.</hi> 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Judicial Offices</hi> are not grantable in <hi>Reversion;</hi> but <hi>Ministerial Offices</hi> are; and by <hi>Usage</hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> a <hi>Judicial Office</hi> may be granted in <hi>Reversion.</hi> And <hi>Custom</hi> will make void a Grant, 9 <hi>Rep. Sir George Reynel's Case.</hi> The like of the Office of <hi>Prothonotary, Clerk of the Pipe, Remembrancer,</hi> and <hi>Chamberlain of the Exchequer.</hi> But where <hi>Usage</hi> has not prevail'd, there it is otherwise; as in case of an <hi>Aulnager, Customer, Controller, Sheriff, Coroner: Vide</hi> 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. And there is nothing here in the nature of the thing it self, to disable this <hi>Grant.</hi> For there is no <hi>Trust</hi> in the case; all that the Officer has to do, is to write after a <hi>Copy;</hi> as the making of <hi>Subpoena's,</hi> and Sealing them is granted <hi>for years,</hi> and held good. And the Officer here has liberty to make a <hi>Deputy,</hi> so that no Inconvenience can arise: And this Excuses any Disability that may be in his person; as a <hi>Register's Office</hi> granted to an <hi>Infant</hi> in <hi>Reversion</hi> was held good for that reason; <hi>Young's Case,</hi> 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> And if it were otherwise, it would be dangerous to many Grants: And before the Case of <hi>Sir George Reynel,</hi> 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> the Law was taken otherwise, as in 30 <hi>Eliz.</hi> So he concluded <hi>pro Defendente,</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> was given accordingly.</p>

                  <hi>Stevens</hi> Argued for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> That it ought not to be allowed: <hi>Vide the Book of Rates, Rule</hi> 8. <hi>First,</hi> The Duty of <hi>Tonnage</hi> is due upon the <hi>Importation,</hi> and the Allowance for <hi>Leakage</hi> is to be made then and not afterwards: <hi>Vide</hi> the <hi>Tenth Clause in the Book of Rates. Secondly,</hi> There was no Allowance for <hi>Leakage</hi> till the <hi>Long Parliament,</hi> I mean no allowance by Act of Parliament, but such Allowances as were made by Particular Order of King and Council; as appears in the Reign of <hi>Queen Elizabeth, King James,</hi> and <hi>King Charles the First.</hi> In the 8th <hi>year</hi> of <hi>King James,</hi> the King appointed a certain Allowance to be made, wherewith the Merchants were not satisfied. Whereupon in 10 <hi>Jacobi</hi> the Rate of 12 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> was setled by Patent to be allowed upon <hi>due Entries</hi> made: And afterwards, as I said, it was setled by Act of Parliament. But it was never meant, that it should be in the power of the Merchants, after their <hi>Wines</hi> are come into Port, to fill up the Vessels, and yet to be allowed 12 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> for <hi>Leakage:</hi> For then it were not properly <hi>Leakage,</hi> but Wine spilt at Sea in the coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Entry is a <hi>due Entry,</hi> if the <hi>true Content</hi> be Entred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> I deny that, with respect to <hi>Leakage:</hi> For if the Merchants must be allowed for it, then must the <hi>due Entry</hi> be of more than perhaps is really come into Port: As in this Case, If <hi>due Entry</hi> had been made, there ought <hi>Eight and Fifty Ton</hi> to have been Entred; <hi>viz.</hi> the quantity that was Laden aboard. Vnless a Vessel were so run out, that there were but ten or eleven Ton left within; and then such Vessel need not be Entred; but else it must: And the Entry must be
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:52142:152"/> of the Contents of the number of Vessels that were shipp'd, and in no other manner: <hi>See the Book of Rates.</hi> After the Vessels are fill's up, there cannot be properly said to be any <hi>Leakage;</hi> and the Act must be Expounded <hi>secundum subjectam Materiam.</hi> And this Act must be Expounded beneficially for advancing the King's Revenue. Now 45 <hi>Shillings</hi> is given to the King for every <hi>Ton,</hi> and 12 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> allowed out of the whole for <hi>Leakage;</hi> which must be understood of the Number of Tons that are when the Ships arrive, <hi>Leakage</hi> not reckon'd: There must be no consideration of that in the 45 <hi>Shillings,</hi> because it is allowed for in the 12 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> He concluded for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lechmere</hi> for the <hi>Defendant. First,</hi> The <hi>Duty</hi> is to be paid upon Vnlading: <hi>See Waller and Hanger's Case,</hi> 9 <hi>Jac.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Prizage,</hi> which though a Duty payable to the Crown by the Common Law, there was yet a Doubt, whether it could at all vest till the Vnlading: But the Duty in our Case is not a <hi>Duty</hi> at Common Law. And in <hi>Swinnerton's Case,</hi> the King granted for years the <hi>Customs</hi> of such a Port; a Vessel came into Port, and before Vnlading the Grantées term Expired, and another Grant took place, and the Question was, whether of the two should have the <hi>Custom</hi> of that Ship's Cargo? That Case was ended by Compromise; but the better Opinion was, that no Duty became due till <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lading.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Law favours <hi>Merchants,</hi> for the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Trade, and there is no reason why they should pay <hi>Customs</hi> for nothing, which here the Merchant would do, if he were compell'd to pay for <hi>six Ton</hi> more than is arrived, or for <hi>six Ton</hi> spilt at Sea: Sée the <hi>Book, fo.</hi> 10. concerning <hi>Piracy</hi> and <hi>Loss at Sea;</hi> yet is that but a Declaration of the Common Law. <hi>Vide Dyer</hi> 43. 1 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp; Pl. Com. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gassa's Case;</hi> lost by <hi>Tempest;</hi> and the Case of 31 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. of Goods, that perish after they are come into Harbour, that no Custom shall be paid for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis a hard case, if a <hi>true Entry</hi> of all that is in the Ship, shall not be accounted a <hi>due Entry:</hi> But that Entry must be made of all that was shipp'd, though it be gone before the Vessel arrives; in which case it would be a <hi>false Entry</hi> to Enter it. So that according to this, a <hi>true Entry</hi> shall not be a <hi>due Entry;</hi> but a <hi>false Entry</hi> shall. Nor is it material what the Number or Contents of the Vessels are; nor whether a Ton of Wine be in one or two Vessels: Custom is paid by the <hi>Ton,</hi> and that is reckon'd by the <hi>Quantum,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:52142:153"/> respect to the Vessels. So he concluded for the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> Custom is due for Goods Imported, when the Ship begins to <hi>break Bulk.</hi> And the 12 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for <hi>Leakage,</hi> is in lieu of <hi>Five pounds per Cent.</hi> allowed upon other Commodities: And there is the more allowed upon <hi>Liquors,</hi> because they are subject to more Loss at Sea by Importation, than <hi>dry Goods</hi> are. But I take it, that <hi>Leakage</hi> is allowed in respect of the hazard the Wines run of being lessened in quantity by Running at Sea; and therefore that the Original Contents of the Vessels, when they were put on Board, and full, is to be regarded. <hi>Adjornatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Michaelmass Term,</hi> the Barons delivered their Opinions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Rainesford pro Quer'.</hi> He argued, That <hi>Leakage</hi> is not allowable for these 52 <hi>Tons</hi> fill'd up. <hi>First, Leakage</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes due by Consent and mutual Compact of King and Subject, as appears by 8 <hi>&amp;</hi> 10 <hi>Jac.</hi> which has been cited, before which time no <hi>Leakage</hi> was allowed. And by this Contract it was to be allowed upon <hi>due</hi> Entry made; which is not here. And this Case may be compared to the 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>of Wills;</hi> where the King has a third part by agreement, as it were, for the loss of his Wardship. But <hi>cessante causâ cessat effectus:</hi> As if an Annuity be granted <hi>pro Consilio impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,</hi> or to repair a Park. If the Grantee refuse to give Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or the Park be destroyed, the <hi>Annuity</hi> ceases, 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 19. 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 5. 41 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 6. 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 7. And if it were allowed, the King would lose his Customs of <hi>six Ton,</hi> which will be 22 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Loss to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 'Twill be hard upon the <hi>Merchant</hi> to pay for 58 <hi>Ton;</hi> the allowance of 12 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> will not be proportionable to his Loss.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> It is all that the Act allows, and it ought to content him. And though it be not a sufficient recompence for <hi>Spanish</hi> Wines, it is a very large recompence for <hi>French</hi> Wines: So that taking one with another, the Recompence is valuable for both. Besides the Merchant is not to pay the Duty till Landing, by the 1st and 10th <hi>Rule;</hi> and in case of Corrupt Wines, or Exportation, he pays no Subsidy, which are great Benefits allowed him. <hi>Obj.</hi> The 8th <hi>Rule. Resp.</hi> The Duty of <hi>Custom</hi> arises and becomes due upon <hi>Importation,</hi> but is not payable till <hi>Landing:</hi> So that the filling up the Leaky Vessels after the Importation, makes this an <hi>undue Entry;</hi> and the Merchant thereby loseth the allowance for <hi>Leakage,</hi> which would else be made him.</p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:52142:153"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Turner accordant.</hi> Without <hi>due Entry</hi> no allowance to be made for <hi>Leakage</hi> by the Act. There are here three things considerable; <hi>First,</hi> Whether the Entry be to be made according to the Number and Continent of the <hi>Vessels,</hi> or according to the Quantity of the Wines contained in them? And I hold, that the Entry ought to be according to the Content and Number of the Vessels, and not according to the Quantity of the Wines contained therein: For that is the surest way for the King to be answered his Duty, the certainty of which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not else be so well known. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the Entry ought to be of what is <hi>Imported,</hi> or of what is <hi>Landed?</hi> I take it, that the Entry must be of the Wines imported: For the Duty becomes due by the Importation before Landing; though it shall not be paid, in case after Importation, and before Landing, the Ship miscarry through some accident or other, by the Hand of God. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I think the Entry here is an <hi>undue</hi> Entry, because there are not so many Vessels Entred as are Imported, and that therefore no <hi>Leakage</hi> is to be allowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Atkyns accordant.</hi> Custom is paid to the King for his Protecting Merchants in their Trade by Sea, <hi>Dyer</hi> 43. And it becomes due by Importation, and before Landing, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that a <hi>Pardon</hi> after Importation, and before Landing, will not discharge the Duty; and so is <hi>Hanger's Case,</hi> 9 <hi>Jac.</hi> in case of <hi>Prizage.</hi> This allowance of <hi>Leakage</hi> is grounded upon a Contract and Agreement betwixt the King and the Merchants, which ought to bind them; and it is only to be allowed when a <hi>due</hi> Entry is made, which is not here. So he concluded <hi>pro Rege.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron</hi> to the same purpose. First, I will consider of some Exceptions to the Information: <hi>First,</hi> That there is no <hi>Latin</hi> word in the Information for the Species of the Wine; it is only said <hi>Quinquaginta quinque pipas Vini, Anglicè Canary Wine,</hi> without saying <hi>Hispanicè.</hi> Yet I hold it to be well enough, for that is only a specification of the Wine, and the General being expressed in <hi>Latin</hi> is sufficient; as in 24 <hi>Car. B.R. Ro.</hi> 431. the word <hi>Ferrum, Anglicè Iron-Bars:</hi> So the word <hi>Stannum, Anglicè Pewter-Dishes,</hi> or <hi>Platters,</hi> is sufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more: And yet there are <hi>Latin</hi> words by which these things might be express'd. A <hi>second Exception</hi> is this; <hi>viz.</hi> it does not appear that the Wine forfeited was seized. For <hi>Two and fifty Tuns</hi> were Entred, and Custom paid for them and yet Six of them seized for Non-payment of Custom. <hi>Resp.</hi> All the Custom is not paid, because <hi>Leakage</hi> is demanded to be allowed, which must not be here allowed; and then the case is no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> There is Custom due for
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:52142:154"/> an <hi>Hundred</hi> Pipes of Wines, and there is only so much paid, as <hi>Ninety</hi> Pipes come to; in that case some of the <hi>Hundred</hi> Pipes may without question be seized for this Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Now for the matter in Law, there are thrée things here to be enquired into. <hi>First,</hi> At what time <hi>Custom</hi> becoms due. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> According to what <hi>Proportion</hi> it must be paid. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> In what Case <hi>Leakage</hi> is to be allowed? For the first: Custom is not due till <hi>Landing.</hi> For goods may be import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by stress of Weather, or for want of Water or Victuals, and not by way of Merchandize; and if they are not import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Merchandize, no Custom is due; but if imported as Merchandize, the Act of Tunnage and Poundage séems to make them lyable to the Duty upon the Importation: But this is corrected by other Acts, and by the Rules in the <hi>Book of Rates</hi> added to the Act: And by the Common Law, Customs are not due upon the Importation unless some Act by way of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize be done, as breaking Bulk, selling part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this appears by the Acts of 28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. And here though the Act of Tunnage and Poundage makes it due upon the Importation, yet the first Rule in the <hi>Book of Rates</hi> corrects it, and makes it due upon the <hi>Landing</hi> only, and not fore more than is brought ashore: With which <hi>Swinner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's Case</hi> agrées, that has bèen cited. And this is different from that of <hi>Prizage:</hi> Which becomes due upon <hi>breaking of Bulk,</hi> as appears in <hi>Hanger's Case.</hi> And the Reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Acts of 28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. do not extend to <hi>Prizage,</hi> but to <hi>Customs</hi> only: So that <hi>Prizage</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains as it was at Common Law, before the Acts made. A <hi>Second</hi> thing to be considered, is, whether the Duty be to be paid according to the Content of the Vessel, or according to the quantity of Wine that is really contained in the Vessel? Now if a <hi>Hogshead</hi> of Wine were imported in a <hi>Pipe,</hi> Custom should be paid but for a <hi>Hogshead;</hi> for else it would be very unreasonable. <hi>Vide</hi> 27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. and this may well enough be made to appear, either by the <hi>King's Gager,</hi> or by the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's Information</hi> at his Peril. And concerning these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betwéen the King, the Merchant and the Buyer, sée the Acts of 27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8. 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 17. 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. And there is no penalty imposed for not filling the Cask, but for false measure there is; and therefore I take it, that the Duty is to be paid according to the true estimate of the quantity, and by no other Rule.</p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:52142:154"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The third Consideration in the Case is, that of <hi>Leakage;</hi> which we must consider thrée ways. <hi>Frist, Before</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. <hi>Secondly, After</hi> Landing. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after,</hi> with respect to the <hi>Loss,</hi> that is sustained by it. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what Consideration there was an Allowance made for it, whether in respect of the <hi>Loss</hi> sustained, or of the <hi>Custom</hi> paid, or upon what other account, it was dubious, as also in what proportion it should be allowed, till 8 <hi>&amp;</hi> 10 <hi>Jacob.</hi> 1. which settles it by Order of Court at 12 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> upon <hi>due Entry</hi> made. And that was as it were the <hi>Medium</hi> agreed upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Merchants;</hi> Till the 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. till which time Allowance was made accordingly: And there had béen two different Entries made, as there were in this Case; <hi>viz.</hi> one by the <hi>Master,</hi> and the other by the <hi>Merchant,</hi> the Merchants Entry would have béen Conclusive for the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for Leakage. But now the word Leaking is got into an Act of Parliament, and is an Allowance made to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant upon a <hi>due Entry,</hi> made by him according to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract: And otherwise it is not to be allowed; nor ought it here to be allowed, because the Entry here is not according to the <hi>Original Contract,</hi> to which the Act, which now allows it, has respect, as to the original cause of it: And as has béen said, <hi>Cessante causâ cessat effectus.</hi> And this I take to be the sole Ground and Reason, why that Allowance is not to be made here; <hi>viz.</hi> because the Merchant has not in this Case made an Entry, according to the nature of his <hi>Contract. Object.</hi> Since the Act of Parliament has taken place, no notice ought now to be taken of that Contract. <hi>Resp.</hi> But yet the Reason of this Allowance may be enquired into, And that was the <hi>due Entry</hi> of all Wines Imported. <hi>Object.</hi> It was allowed for the Encouragement of Merchants. <hi>Resp.</hi> But with a Reteos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the Contract, and in consideration of that. <hi>Object.</hi> If the Allowance be not here made, the Merchant's Loss will not be recompenced. <hi>Resp.</hi> It was not allowed in respect of the Loss only: But also in respect of the Customs paid upon the Importation, and of over paying the Customs when the Casks were not full. And if the Merchant will fill up his Casks and so decrease the Customs, as he may, if he please, then Leakage ceaseth. And though so much run out, that he would not be recompenced for his Loss in this case, if he paid Custom for <hi>Fifty eight</hi> Ton, yet he would be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced according to Contract. And if the recompence be short as to one sort of Wines, it is full and over as to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>viz.</hi> for all <hi>French</hi> Wines. So that <hi>Consideratis Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderandis,</hi>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:52142:155"/> the Merchant receives a Satisfaction: He may fill up his Casks after importation; but then he waives his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the <hi>Leakage:</hi> And shall pay the duty only for so many Tons full measure. So he concluded for the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was given accordingly.</p>

The Court held likewise, that after such <hi>Defence</hi> as aforesaid, <hi>Priviledge</hi> may be allowed: For it is not a full Defence, nor does he go about to ouste the Court of Iurisdiction; but only claims his Priviledge.

And for Security, the said <hi>Parker</hi> took an Obligation of <hi>Six hundred pounds</hi> in the King's name, (the Debt being <hi>Three hundred pounds</hi>) Condition'd to pay 300 <hi>l.</hi> with Interests to <hi>Parker.</hi> Afterwards the Mony not being paid, <hi>Underwood's</hi> Lands and Goods were extended: And Lands were found to the value of <hi>Six pound per Annum</hi> for Life, and Goods to the value of <hi>Two hundred ninety three pounds fifteen shillings and six pence:</hi> Which were return'd in a Schedule. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by Order of Court, upon Security given to abide the Order of the Court, concerning these Goods they were to be restored to <hi>Underwood:</hi> Afterwards <hi>Underwood,</hi> and the now
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:52142:156"/> Defendant <hi>Waring</hi> and one <hi>Jermy,</hi> became joyntly and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bound in a Recognisance of <hi>Six hundred pounds</hi> to the late <hi>King Charles the First,</hi> Conditioned to abide the Order of the Court, as aforesaid. And some time after, the Order not being performed, this Recognisance was put in Suit in the time of the Late Civil Wars, and at last Iudgment was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained upon it; and a Writ of Error brought, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by <hi>Non-suit</hi> after the <hi>Act of Oblivion:</hi> And then the Act was pleaded to a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon the Iudgment; in which are Excepted, <hi>First, All Recognisances, Obligations and other Securities given or entred into, since the five and twentieth of March, One thousand six hundred and forty, by any Receiver, Reve, Bayliff, Collector or Publick Accountant in the Court of the Publick Exchequer, and their Sureties and their Accounts respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively. Secondly,</hi> There are <hi>Excepted</hi> in another Clause, <hi>any Bonds taken in his late Majesty's name, before the month of May. One thousand six hundred forty and two, for securing the proper Debt of any Servant, or Receiver of the Revenue of his said late Majesty, that hath not been paid to, or by order of the same lawful or pretended Authority.</hi> And upon a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer</hi> these <hi>three</hi> Questions arose; <hi>First,</hi> Whether or no this <hi>Recognisance,</hi> were an <hi>Obligation</hi> within the intent of the <hi>second Exception? Secondly,</hi> Whether the Defendant here has <hi>time</hi> to plead? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether he may plead it by <hi>Attorny,</hi> as he does here?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hardres pro Defendente. First, Ex vi termini,</hi> there is a great difference betwixt an <hi>Obligation</hi> and a <hi>Recognisance:</hi> One has the partie's seal set to it, the other has not: And to the one <hi>Non est factum</hi> is a good Plea, but not to the other. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The words of this Act, being an Act of Grace, must be taken Extensively and most Beneficially for the Subject: And so the Act it self directs. And consequently, Exceptions out of the Act must be taken strictly, because they restrain the favour of the Law. <hi>Hill.</hi> 11. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Bell's Case in B. R. Cro.</hi> 1. <hi>Rep.</hi> 324. the Act of General Pardon in 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. Excepts <hi>All Offences in taking away, Imbezeling, or purloyning any the King's Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie's Goods, Mony, Chattels, &amp;c.</hi> And yet it was adjudged that the Felony in purloyning them, was not Excepted. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> The different ways of penning these two Exceptions shew as much; for in the former <hi>Recognisances</hi> are named, but not in the latter: Which shews that the makers of the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to except them in one Clause and not in the other. <hi>Vide Cro.</hi> 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 258. <hi>Priest's Case. Fourthly,</hi> Here the Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisance was not entred into to secure a Debt owing to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, but to perform the Order of the Court, and to answer
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:52142:157"/> the value of the Goods Restored, that had béen extended upon a former Obligation, given to the King for the Debt of his Receiver, as aforesaid. So that this Recognizance is Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral to the original Debt. And shall not be taken to be a Security for the Receiver's Debt, within the meaning of this Exception, which must be taken strictly. As in <hi>Drywood's Case,</hi> 5 <hi>Rept.</hi> 48. <hi>b.</hi> in the General pardon of 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>all Suits depending to be prosecuted,</hi> does not extend to a <hi>Bill</hi> in the <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> where the Plaintiff Dies: Though the Attorny General may Prosecute after the Plaintiff's Death; because the Intention of the Exception was, to be Prosecuted by the <hi>Party himself. Fifthly,</hi> Here the Recognisance is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a Iudgment, which being of a higher nature, the Recognisance is now drown'd; 6 <hi>Rep. Dowdale's Case.</hi> Here the Original Obligation given to the King by <hi>Parker</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in force, notwithstanding that there has béen Execution sued out upon it; for that there was but part of the Debt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed: So that take the Exception never so strict, yet that will be within the benefit of it. In the 8 <hi>Rept.</hi> 138. <hi>b. Sir Francis Barrington's Case:</hi> An Exception of Wood for his Vse and Occupation, does not extend to Wood <hi>Cut down and Sold</hi> by him; but to Wood Cut down <hi>for Repairs, Firing, &amp;c.</hi> And in 7. <hi>Rep.</hi> 18. <hi>b. Cecill's Case,</hi> Remedy given by 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 39. in Debts due to the King upon <hi>Obligation,</hi> does not extend to an Obligation for <hi>performance of Covenants.</hi> So here, there being a new Debt treated to the King, by Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon this Recognisance, the Recognisance is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Exception.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Second Point;</hi> I conceive the Plea comes time enough. <hi>First,</hi> Because it is an <hi>Equitable Plea,</hi> upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 39. And this Court is a Court for the Revenue, and a Court of <hi>Equity</hi> as well as of Law. <hi>Vide</hi> 6 <hi>Co. Sir Edward Phitton's Case,</hi> where an Executor may come in and have the Benefit of a Pardon without process.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because no <hi>Audita Querela</hi> lies against the King, and therefore the party has time after Iudgment given against him, to plead; as has béen adjudged in 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 10. 8 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Keilw.</hi> 187. 34 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 15. 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Defendant may plead by <hi>Attorney,</hi> because here is a Suit by <hi>Scire facias;</hi> as in 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 1. And prayed Iudgment for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stephens pro Quer'. First,</hi> An <hi>Obligation</hi> and a <hi>Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance</hi> are all one in substance: For a Recognizance binds the party, as well as an Obligation; and it was not the Intention
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:52142:157"/> of the Act to bar Iust Debts due to Subjects, as appears by the Exceptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Defendant has no Day to plead, for it is after Iudgment, and a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Nonsuit</hi> thereupon; and the Act of <hi>Pardon</hi> came out before the Error was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He cannot plead by <hi>Attorney,</hi> for the Defendant's <hi>Warrant of Attorney</hi> determines by the Iudgment; but the Plaintiff's does not till Execution, 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 1. And pray'd Iudgment for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Trinity Term</hi> it was argued again by <hi>Sir Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Atkyns</hi> for the Defendant; and by <hi>Mr. Mountague,</hi> the Quéens Attorney for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Robert Atkyns.</hi> The <hi>Recognizance</hi> in this case is not an <hi>Obligation</hi> within the Exception, <hi>Vid. Co. Lit.</hi> 172. that <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> is a word in its own nature of a large extent; but it is commonly taken in the Common Law, for a Bond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a penalty, with Condition for payment of Mony; that is, the strict Legal sense of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to be bound by a Writing sealed and delivered for the payment of any thing, Corn, Mony, or other things, <hi>Dyer</hi> 24, 25. And that is the Common and Vulgar acceptation of the word also; and so it must here be understood. But a <hi>Recognizance</hi> is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in Court, and the party's Seal is not affir'd to it; as it is to a Recognizance in the nature of a Statute Staple. He cited <hi>Cro.</hi> 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 444. <hi>Co.</hi> 3 <hi>Inst.</hi> 169. <hi>Mag. Chart.</hi> 678. that it is the Seal of the Party that makes the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the <hi>first</hi> Exception <hi>Recognizances</hi> are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and therefore shall not be taken to be within the second, because not express'd. And Security taken in the King's Name, is not usually taken by Recognizance; and therefore shall not be intended to be within the <hi>Exception,</hi> which must be construed beneficially for the Subject, as the Act it self must.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If <hi>Recognizances</hi> were within the <hi>Exception,</hi> yet they would not extend to the Recognizance in question, because it was not taken for the <hi>Security of a proper Debt;</hi> but is taken <hi>Collaterally:</hi> And the Obligation given to the King before is within the Exception, and therefore the Recognizance is not.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Second Point;</hi> The Plea here comes time enough, because the party has no other remedy, 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 20. 34 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.</p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:52142:158"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But he ought to plead in <hi>Proper person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> He needs not; and the Case cited is of a <hi>Capias pro fine,</hi> where the party can appear no otherwise; and concluded <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Mountague pro Quer'. First,</hi> A <hi>Recognizance</hi> is an <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> though it be not a <hi>Deed:</hi> For it has words Obligatory, and that makes it properly an Obligation. And so it is called, <hi>An Obligation Recorded; Mr. Dalton</hi> 116. <hi>Dyer</hi> 21. <hi>a.</hi> the word <hi>Recepisse</hi> is a word Obligatory; so the word <hi>Debere, Ibidem; Vide Yelverton's Rep. Dobson &amp; Key's Case,</hi> 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 65. <hi>Cro.</hi> 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 494. And as a Fine is reputed a Feoffment upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, so a Recognizance is no more than an Obligation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is within the <hi>Exception,</hi> because it ariseth out of the former Security, and is grounded upon it; and where the Principal is Excepted, all Incidents and Consequences are Excepted likewise: <hi>Vide</hi> 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 47. and <hi>Littleton's Case</hi> there. <hi>Vide</hi> 6 <hi>Rep. Phitton's Case, &amp; Co.</hi> 12 <hi>Rep. Ford's Case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the <hi>Third Point,</hi> he held that he ought to have been in person, and cited 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Pardon</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the <hi>Court</hi> delivered their Opinions for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi> Though an Obligation be not a Recognizance in pleading, yet it may well be so within the meaning of an Act of Parliament. And in <hi>Sir Robert Tracy's Case,</hi> a Promise to become bound in a <hi>Thousand Pounds,</hi> may be perform'd by acknowledging a Recognizance, or a Statute; and here is the same Reason. And Debt in Aid is within this Exception; and so is a Debt <hi>Assigned,</hi> as has lately been Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in <hi>Turner's Case,</hi> which are more strong Cases than ours: For they are not Debts owing to the King immediately; and here the Recognizance is grafted upon, and takes its rise from the former Obligation, which is within the Letter of the Exception: And this resembles in some sort a <hi>Nomine poenae,</hi> annex'd to a Rent; which shall go the <hi>Heir,</hi> as the Rent does. And the End and Design of this. Recognizance is to secure the Debt owing to the King's Receiver. And the words of the Exception are not <hi>for paying,</hi> but <hi>for securing the proper Debt of any Servant or Receiver, &amp;c.</hi> Though <hi>per Hale Chief Baron,</hi> if the words had béen <hi>for paying,</hi> the Law would have been the same. And this Recognizance was acknowledged, to secure a Debt owing to the Receiver, and comes in lieu of it. But for the <hi>Second Point,</hi> If this were a good plea, it
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:52142:158"/> comes in well enough without any Continuance, which serves to no other purpose, but to shew that the Iudgment remains in force unreversed: <hi>Vide</hi> the Statute of 5 <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. And he is regular enough in pleading it by <hi>Attorney.</hi> A Warrant of Attorney for the Defendant determines by Iudgment; but a Warrant of Attorney for the Plaintiff determines not till Execution sued, or a year after the Iudgment, because then the Plaintiff is put to his <hi>Scire facias:</hi> But here it is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an <hi>Original Suit,</hi> and he is (as it were) a <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> as appears by the Form of Pleading, in which he <hi>complains</hi> that he <hi>Unjustly vex'd:</hi> And Iudgment was given <hi>pro Rege, nisi, &amp;c.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>UPon a Bill in Equity at the Relation of the said <hi>Hog-skins,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(1)"/> the case was this; <hi>viz.</hi> The Defendant <hi>Guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> was made Master of the Mint in the time of the <hi>Keepers of the Liberties</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>Hogskins</hi> was an Officer there. And there were <hi>Articles</hi> Indented betwixt the said Kéepers and the Defendant concerning the Mint; by which the Defendant was obliged to pay the Vnder-Officers there, and was to have allowed him for his own Salary, <hi>Four Hundred pounds</hi> a year, and other Covenants there were on both sides: And Wages being due to <hi>Hogskins</hi> as an Officer; the King was restored, and all publick Debts, Duties, and Securities, due and given before, were thereby vested in him. Then comes the Act of <hi>Oblivion</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges all Debts, Duties, Suits and Demands, which the King can pardon; except those Excepted in the Act. To a Bill preferr'd against <hi>Guerdon</hi> in this case for Wages due to <hi>Hogskins,</hi> the Defendant Demurr'd: And the Court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving<pb n="372" facs="tcp:52142:159"/> a Doubt of the Matter, saved the benefit of it to the Defendant at the Hearing of the Cause. And the Cause coming to be heard, it was urged for the Plaintiff, that these Covenants, are not pardoned, because the King has them only in <hi>Trust,</hi> and for the benefit of other persons: And it was not the Intent of the Act, that the King should pardon or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge any thing, but what he might lawfully pardon; for <hi>id possumus, quod jure possumus.</hi> As if before the Act of <hi>Pardon</hi> the King had granted over an Obligation, or other Security, or Issues forfeited, the Grantee would not have lost the benefit of the Grant by the Pardon, for they could not lawfully be discharged by the King, being granted out of him. So here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> These Covenants are <hi>Excepted</hi> by the Exception which saves <hi>the Accounts of Persons who have received any of the Rents and Revenues of any Lands or Hereditaments,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paragr. 10.</note>
                  <hi>of or belonging to &amp;c.</hi> The Proffit of the <hi>Mint</hi> is an <hi>Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> being an Ancient Revenue of the Crown. It is also Excepted by the words <hi>Recognizances,</hi>

                  <hi>Bonds, and other Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities given or entred into by any Receiver, Reeve, Bayliff, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, or other Accountant in the Court of Publick Exchequer, &amp;c.</hi> As the Defendant now is by virtue of the Patent for his Office, Granted to him by the <hi>Keepers of the Liberties,</hi> as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>To which the <hi>Defendant</hi>'s Councel answered: <hi>First,</hi> That these <hi>Covenants</hi> were pardoned, because they are now in the Eye of the Law made with the King, and it is in his power to discharge them; and tho' he has them only <hi>in trust,</hi> and for the benefit of others, yet that is not saved by the Act. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Covenants</hi> are not saved by either of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi> that have been urged; because the first <hi>Exception</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends only to <hi>Ordinary Accountants,</hi> for the Revenues of his Lands and Tenements, &amp;c. not to those that receive any part of his Revenues, not being appointed so to do, as Officer or Receiver. Nor does the other Exception affect this Case, for it is to be understood of such Accountants as are so upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and so chargeable, and must have their Discharges here. But the Defendant is not such an Accountant; for by his Patent he is made accountable only before a Particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to be assign'd to him, from whom he is to have his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and not in the Exchequer; as the Exception is to be intended. And this seem'd to be the Opinion of the Court; but the <hi>Barons</hi> wish'd the parties to agrée amongst themselves. And the Cause was <hi>Adjourned.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:52142:159"/>
               <p>At another Day in the same Term the <hi>Court</hi> delivered their Opinions, That the Bill ought to be <hi>dismiss'd:</hi> And two Points were made in the Case: <hi>First,</hi> Whether or no there be proper Plaintiffs before the Court, and such as are entituled to be relieved? And they held in the Negative; because here the Covenants being vested in the <hi>King</hi> as a <hi>Publick Trustee,</hi> no remedy lies against him, as there does upon an Original Covenant by the <hi>King,</hi> upon the behalf, and for the use and benefit of another person. And because the Remedy here is not <hi>Reciprocal,</hi> there is no reason why the <hi>King</hi> should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: But upon an Original Covenant by the <hi>King,</hi> there Relief lies upon and against all that claim under him; because it was <hi>Originally</hi> in the <hi>King</hi> by his own Contract; and so it was held in <hi>Sir John Baker's Case,</hi> 8 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. in this Court. But in this Case there was no Contract made with or by the <hi>King.</hi> And therefore the <hi>King</hi> not being chargeable himself,<note place="margin">☜</note> ought not to charge another.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second Point</hi> was, Whether or no this was within the <hi>Act of Oblivion?</hi> and they held it was within the Benefit of the <hi>Act.</hi> For admitting that it were an Original Trust in the <hi>King,</hi> yet he may release or pardon this Debt or Covenant, because the Interest in Law is in him; and the words of the Pardon are large and comprehensive, and will reach all Debts owing to the King, though in Trust, if not excepted. And so it must be in all General Pardons; and here it is stronger against the party, because himself is a party to it. Nor is it within any of the <hi>Exceptions.</hi> It is not within the Exception,<note place="margin">Paragr. 16.</note> whereby <hi>Detaining, Imbezelling, &amp;c. any the Goods, Mony, Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, &amp;c. of the late King, Queen, or Prince, &amp;c.</hi> are Excepted. For that Clause extends only to such Goods as they were actually possess'd of and appertain'd to them, and not to such as they might for the future come to be entitled to. And all <hi>Accountants,</hi> generally speaking, are not Excepted; for then the Exception would be so large and comprehensive, that but very little would be pardoned. For every taking and receiving of any part of the Revenue or Goods, &amp;c. of the <hi>King,</hi> makes a man accountable to him: But such <hi>Accountants</hi> were not universally intended to be Excepted. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is not within the Exception of <hi>Accountants</hi> for the Profit of <hi>Lands, Tenements,</hi> or <hi>Hereditaments.</hi> For this Account is not of the Revenue of any <hi>Hereditament,</hi> but of the profit or product of the <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>Mint.</hi> Which though it may be styled an <hi>Hereditament</hi> in the <hi>Crown,</hi> yet cannot reasonably be supposed to be included within this <hi>Exception. Thirdly,</hi> It is not within the Exception of <hi>Bonds or Securities,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:52142:160"/> given by any Receiver or other Accountant in the Exchequer,</hi> though the Defendant in this Cause gave Security; because the matter here does not lye properly in <hi>Account,</hi> but in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and so collateral to the Contract. And the <hi>Accounts</hi> meant in this Exception, are such as are ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and well known in the Court, &amp;c. and not such as arise by other means, as this does. And the Defendant cannot be charged or discharged by the Court; but by the direction of his Patent must be accountable to Particular persons, who have power to give him a Discharge; and therefore this Case is not within that Exception.

                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The finding of the Iury, That they do not find that any Lands were devised by the <hi>later Will,</hi> is a void Finding; for it is Negative, and therefore superfluous. <hi>Vide</hi> 1st <hi>Rep.

And that they should pay Tithes for all other Lands, there and elsewhere, out of the said Grange of <hi>Hemmingford,</hi> and that the said Abbot and Convent should pay Annually to the said Prebend and his Successors the sum of <hi>five Marks,</hi> by equal Portions, the one moity to be paid at <hi>Easter,</hi> and the other moity at <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass:</hi> They further find, that upon the 12th of <hi>November, Anno Dom.</hi> 1359. there was <hi>another Composition</hi> made betwixt them under the Seal of the Convent and the Prebend, reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the former Composition (but they do not find that it was confirm'd by the Patron and Ordinary) and by this latter Composition, the Prebend and his Successors for all time to come were to have their election yearly, either to receive Tithes in kind of Corn and Grain arising within the places aforesaid, as well of Lands in the hands of the Abbot and Convent, as in the hands and manurance of their Tenants, or else to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>five Marks</hi> to be paid by the said Abbot and Convent in lieu thereof, so as such election were notified to the Abbot, or to any of the Monks resident within five Miles of the Abby, or to the Porter of the Abby, upon or before the feast of <hi>St. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Francis Goodrick pro Quer. First,</hi> He considered that this last Composition was good, though not confirmed, because it was for the <hi>Melioration</hi> of the Church, and gave them a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, which they had not by the first. And the Rule is, that a Parson, Prebend or other sole Ecclesiastical Corporation, <hi>potest meliorare, sed non pejorare Conditionem &amp; statum Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae. Vid. Bro.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He considered, whether this Priviledge to be discharg'd of Tithes, be such a personal Priviledge, as that it cannot be released? And he conceived it might be released and waived; for that <hi>Quilibet potest renunciare juri pro se in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducto.</hi> 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> 252. <hi>Dyer</hi> 249. <hi>Dr. Goodman's Case.</hi> Also here the Corporation being extinct, the Priviledge is gone, and the Tithes are revived, <hi>as Bro.

               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:52142:164"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pro Defendente. First,</hi> The first Composition here is well rooted and settled, and is in the nature of an Exchange, as appears 2 <hi>Rep.</hi> 45. 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> 490. <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 42. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It séems not to be destroy'd by the second. For the second is, only by way of Collateral Agréement and sounds in Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant: There are no words in it of Grant or Release. And it cannot here be déemed an Elegible Inheritance, because it does not pass from both parties. And by a Release of five Marks, the whole would be discharged; so that it is not reciprocal, 44 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 5. Also the Corporation being dissolv'd, the second Composition falls of it self. And it shall not be presumed, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position was confirmed, unless it be shewn, because the former, which is more ancient, was confirmed. So he concluded for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> By the first Composition the Abbot only is discharged, <hi>quamdiù propriis manibus, &amp;c.</hi> but by the latter the Abbot and his Tenants are discharged of Tithes of Corn and Hay only; so that there is a great difference betwixt these two Compositions. But he conceived, <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>first</hi> Composition was good, although the Abbot were discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his order, <hi>quamdiù, &amp;c. Secondly,</hi> That the Abbot may well renounce the benefit of his Priviledge. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there may well be a Relinquishment of the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and that it may be released or discharged. But the doubt in this case is, whether or no the second Composition be good in Law without a Confirmation, and an Annual Election, according to the Composition, and who must make this Election, and how, now that the Prebend is dissolved, and by whom, and to whom the notice must be given. There was one <hi>Southwell's Case,</hi> in 44 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Where an Abbot had had certain quantity of Wood, to be taken yearly in such a Wood, or else a certain sum of Mony yearly <hi>at his Election:</hi> And it was held in that Case, that the <hi>Election</hi> was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the King, by the Statute of Dissolution of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries: And that it should go along with the Land to the <hi>King's</hi> Patentée. But here this Prebend came to the King by the Stat. of 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>of Chantries, &amp;c.</hi> and whether the Election in this case remains or not, may be a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Trin. Term Anno</hi> 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. It was argued again by Serjeant <hi>Hardres,</hi> for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:52142:165"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> There has béen a Question stirred, but not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on by the Defendant, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether or no this Priviledge of the Abby, to be frée from payment of Tithes, may be waived or not? I shall not dwell upon that, for I take it to be very clear, that it may be waived. <hi>First,</hi> Because it was but a particular Indulgence granted to the Order of <hi>Cistertians,</hi> and for their benefit and advantage, and therefore it may be waived by them, in like manner, as an Exemption from ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon Iuries, &amp;c. may be waived at one time, and resum'd at another; as is very usual and frequent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is a Rule in Law, that whatever is created may by some means or other be dissolved and extinguished, tho' some things cannot be granted over: As in <hi>Lampett's Case,</hi> 10 <hi>Rep. a possibility of a Term,</hi> though not grantable over, yet may be released to the Tenant in Possession, <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 307. an <hi>Appropriation,</hi> though not grantable over, yet may become disappropriate by a Presentment. <hi>N.B.</hi> 35. 8 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 12. 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 58. <hi>b. A Corody</hi> incertain in an Abby, though not grantable over by the <hi>Founder,</hi> yet may be released and extinguished by him. So here.</p>
               <p>But the second and more difficult Point is this; <hi>viz.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this <hi>second Composition</hi> be good or no, because not <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> by the Patron and Ordinary. And I conceive that it is good notwithstanding, as our ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e is, and that for these Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>second Composition</hi> is wholly for the benefit of the Prebend and his Successors, and is an enlargment of the former, because by this second Composition he has an <hi>Election,</hi> to take either his <hi>five Marks</hi> or his Tithes in <hi>kind,</hi> whether he will; whereas by the <hi>first Composition,</hi> he is tied up to his <hi>five Marks:</hi> And in such cases, Successors are bound though without coonfirmation, 44 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 21, 22. in <hi>Octavian Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard's</hi> Case, Tenant in Tail charged the Land with a Rent charge, for a release of the right of a Stranger; and held that this shall bind the Issue in Tail notwithstanding the <hi>Stat. of Westm.</hi> 2. 48 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>b.</hi> the like of a Recovery in Value by the Tenant in Tail; because the Issue is at no loss by it. <hi>Perk.</hi> 17. Tenant in Tail may determin his Election, as to so many Acres or a Rent Charge, and the Issue shall be bound by it. So here: No loss, but a profit accrues to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding Prebend; and it is a Rule in Law, <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 102. <hi>b.</hi> 341. <hi>a. Mag. Cart.</hi> 3. <hi>a.</hi> that a Parson without his Patron and Ordinary may <hi>meliorare statum Ecclesiae suae.</hi> And so in our Case.</p>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:52142:165"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>second Composition</hi> was made only for a further Explanation of the former, and by way of <hi>Superonera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and is a surcharge upon the Abbot and his Successors, without any <hi>Diminution</hi> to the Prebend. And in that case a confirmation is not requisite. If there be Composition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd betwixt a Parson and his Parishioner, by which the Parishioner is to pay 5 <hi>l.</hi> in lieu of his Tithes for <hi>ten years;</hi> and afterwards another Composition is made, whereby the Parishioner agrées to pay 6 <hi>l.</hi> for those <hi>ten years;</hi> this second is good without a Confirmation, because it is an Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the former, and more for the Parson's advantage than it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The same may be proved by the Parallel, betwixt a <hi>Parson</hi> of a Church and an <hi>Infant:</hi> For our Authorities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble them two to one another. As appears <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 341. <hi>a. Mag. Cart.</hi> 3. <hi>a. Ecclesia infra aetatem existit &amp; fungitur vice mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris.</hi> Now <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 337. <hi>minor statum suum meliorare potest, non deteriorare.</hi> And therefore if an <hi>Infant</hi> submit to an <hi>Award,</hi> which is made for his advantage, he shall be bound by it, 13 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 12. 10 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 10. so if an <hi>Infant</hi> makes <hi>Partition</hi> or Assigns <hi>Dower,</hi> if it be equal and just, he shall be bound and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it: The like of a <hi>Parson.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Third</hi> thing is this; <hi>viz.</hi> admitting that the <hi>second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> is good, Whether or no it be now possible to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because no <hi>Election</hi> can now be made in form as directed by the Composition: Because now the Abby is dissolv'd, and the Corporation extinguisht, and the Prebend also with all it's Possessions is given to the Crown, the one by 31 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. the other by 1 <hi>of Ed.</hi> 6. And yet I conceive all this is no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, but that Tithes in kind may be recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As for the <hi>Dissolution</hi> of the Abby and extinguishment of the Corporation, that will create no impediment, because it comes by the Act of the Corporation it self; to wit, by their <hi>Surrender:</hi> For the Act of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. vests nothing in the King, but what the Abbies themselves surrendred since 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. as appears by the <hi>Statute;</hi> and it is a Rule in Law, that <hi>Res inter alios acta alteri nocere non debet, sed prodesse potest.</hi> If a Lessée for years charge his Estate with a Rent, and then surrender; yet the Charge continues as long as the term would have lasted, if it had béen suffered to run out in time. 5 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for the Accession of the <hi>Prebend</hi> to the Crown by the Statute of <hi>primo Ed.</hi> 6. It is there Enacted, that all Tithes and Hereditaments appertaing to any Hospital given to the King, shall be in him in as ample manner as in the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:52142:166"/> Hospital, and as if they had béen particularly named: And it is also Enacted, That the King shall enjoy all Profits, Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, &amp;c. appertaining to any Hospital by any Assurance, Composition, or otherwise. So that all is preserved for, and reserved to the King, that did appertain to any Hospital. And <hi>Unity of Possession</hi> in the King of the <hi>Abby</hi> and the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend,</hi> breaks no squares; for <hi>Tithes,</hi> and a <hi>Composition</hi> for Tithes, are <hi>Collateral</hi> to the Land, and revive by <hi>Severance,</hi> as appears in 11th <hi>Rep. Harpur's Case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And where there can be no <hi>Election,</hi> there the party that is to have the benefit of it, shall have and enjoy the thing for which the <hi>Recompence</hi> is given, without any <hi>Election.

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The <hi>Prior</hi> of <hi>St. Faith's,</hi> 13 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. made a Grant of 200 <hi>Faggots</hi> or <hi>Focals</hi> to the Hospital of <hi>St. Giles's</hi> in <hi>Norwich,</hi> or of <hi>Twenty shillings</hi> in lieu of them, at the Election of the Hospital, with a Clause of Distress, reasonable Notice of the Election being given; and the Hospital Covenants, to give Notice in the Church belonging to the Hospital. Afterwards the Hospital comes to the Crown <hi>per</hi> 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. who grants over the Hospital, with the said <hi>Rent,</hi> and the Grantée distrains for the <hi>Focals:</hi> And it was there adjudged, <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>Focals</hi> pass by the Grant of the <hi>Hospital,</hi> and the <hi>Rent</hi> of <hi>Twenty shillings,</hi> though the <hi>Focals</hi> are not expressed in the Grant. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there needs no <hi>Election,</hi> because the thing granted was the <hi>Focals,</hi> and the <hi>Twenty shillings</hi> are but by way of <hi>Recompence</hi> for it, and as an allowance and satisfaction for the same. And a difference was taken where the Election was <hi>precedent,</hi> and where <hi>subsequent</hi> to the Grant. If a man grants to another a <hi>Robe,</hi> or <hi>Twenty shillings,</hi> there the <hi>Election</hi> is precedent to the interest of the <hi>Grantee,</hi> here it is not so; <hi>Vide</hi> 2d <hi>Rep. Sir Rowland Heyward's Case.</hi> Now this Case of the <hi>Prior of St. Faith's</hi> resembles our Case in all respects: For here is a Composition for <hi>Tithes</hi> in kind, or else for <hi>five Marks</hi> in lieu; and the Hospital there came to the <hi>King</hi> by 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. as ours does here, and yet the <hi>Election</hi> remained.</p>
               <p>But in our Case there is a Clause, That when there is no <hi>Election</hi> made, the <hi>Prebend</hi> shall content himself with the <hi>five Marks.</hi> But to that I answer, That this Clause must have a reasonable Construction and Intendment; <hi>viz.</hi> That as long as there may be an <hi>Election</hi> made by any reasonable way or means, so long there shall be an <hi>Election,</hi> or else only <hi>Five Marks</hi> due. But here there can be no <hi>Election</hi> made at
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:52142:166"/> all, according to the <hi>Composition,</hi> by reason that the Abby is <hi>Dissolved,</hi> and that by their <hi>own Act;</hi> and it is a Rule in Law. That <hi>Impotentia excusat legem;</hi> and <hi>Lex non cogit ad impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilia,</hi> 42 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 5. If a man Covenant to leave Lands in as good plight as he found them, and Trees are blown down by Tempest, he is excused, 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 20. <hi>Sir Anthony Maine's Case.</hi> A Lessor Covenants to make a new Lease to the Lossée upon surrender of the former; if afterwards he grant the Reversion to another for term of years, the Covenant is broken, though no Surrender be made, for that he has disabled himself to take a Surrender: So in this Case, It being <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>impossible</hi> to make an <hi>Election</hi> through the Abbot's <hi>own Default;</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend, &amp;c. shall have the same advantage that he would have had, without making an <hi>Election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If an <hi>Election</hi> be necessary, the Plaintiff has made his Election, for he has preferr'd his Bill for Tithes, and brought the Cause to <hi>Hearing;</hi> which is the same thing as if he had declar'd at Law; and that does amount to an <hi>Election,</hi> as when a man brings a Writ of Annuity, and counts upon it, 5 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 33. <hi>F.N.B.</hi> 152. Or the bringing of a Writ of <hi>Dower,</hi> and counting upon it, 12 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>Dower</hi> 158. And the bringing of an <hi>Assise</hi> amounts to a <hi>Continual Claim,</hi> 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>Age</hi> 141. So I conclude, that the <hi>Second Composition</hi> is a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that it remains <hi>in force,</hi> for the benefit of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend, and all claiming under him; and that no <hi>Election</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, <hi>quia vana &amp; inutilis;</hi> and that if an <hi>Election</hi> must be made, the Plaintiff here has made his <hi>Election,</hi> and pray'd Iudgment <hi>pro Quer'.</hi>

               <p>Afterwards the <hi>Court</hi> delivered their Opinions, That the second Composition did not affect the Successors of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend, and therefore that the Abbot was not bound by it. The Reason seems to be, because by the <hi>first Composition</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend and his Successors were bound only <hi>quamdiù propriis manibus, &amp;c.</hi> and by the <hi>second Composition</hi> the <hi>five Marks</hi> go in recompence of all, whether <hi>in propriis manibus,</hi> or in the hands of the Tenants. But to this it may be answered, That it is still at the Successor's <hi>Election</hi> to take the <hi>five Marks,</hi> or <hi>Tithes in kind,</hi> and therefore that he is at no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Court</hi> likewise held; That the power of <hi>Election</hi> is gone, because it cannot now be made <hi>according to the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;</hi> and that therefore the <hi>first Composition</hi> should stand, <hi>quo ad terras in propriis manibus;</hi> and for the others, that <hi>Tithes in kind</hi> may be taken, as before: For that the <hi>Election</hi> is destroy'd.

               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Hardres, Recorder</hi> of the City of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for the Sheriff.</p>
               <p>I con eive there is no doubt but this <hi>Franchise</hi> and <hi>Flower of the Crown</hi> may by Law be granted out of it, as well as greater things are, as to be <hi>Exempt from all Juries,</hi> and that <hi>Breve Domini Regis</hi> shall not <hi>currere,</hi> which takes away all Superiority of <hi>Westminster Hall,</hi> as within the <hi>Cinque Ports</hi> and <hi>County Palatines,</hi> of which cases the Books are plentiful, and so they are in our very case, as appears by 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 5. 42 <hi>Ass.</hi> 5. 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 52. 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 42. 39 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Questions and Doubts here, I conceive to be two: <hi>First,</hi> Whether the Exemption here returned will extend and hold place <hi>in casu Regis,</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> is the sole and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate party? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the Sheriff comes in time enough to make such a <hi>Return?</hi> And I hold the Affirmative in both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The words of <hi>Exemption</hi> by the <hi>Charter</hi> are sufficient to extend to the Case in question; for the words are, <hi>Prout, &amp;c. Vide the Words suprà in the Return.</hi> Which extend to our Cuse for these Reasons: <hi>First,</hi> I argue from the Occasion of making this Patent. By the Charter granted to the City 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. and confirmed 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. the Citizens are Exempted from going out of the City before any Iustices of Assize, Iustices of the Peace, Oyer and Terminer, or other Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices or Commissioners, Sheriffs, Escheators, Coroners,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:52142:168"/> or other Iustices or Ministers. <hi>In</hi> 4 <hi>Jacobi Regis,</hi> the validity of this Exemption came in debate, upon an Indictment for a Murder committed in the City by one <hi>Robert Lade,</hi> who remov'd it and himself hither to be tryed, and upon Motion it was referr'd to the then Attorney General <hi>Hobart,</hi> to view the Charter, and certifie the Court, whether or no the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption extended to the Case then before them; who certified that it did not, whereupon the said <hi>Lade</hi> was tryed here and acquitted; because the Grant of 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. did not extend to the Court of <hi>B. R.</hi> as appears by 8 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 21. Conufance granted in all Suits <hi>Coram aliquibus Justiciariis</hi> does not extend to this Court, which is <hi>Coram Rege,</hi> as appears in 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 54. <hi>b.</hi> 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 84. <hi>Dr. Foster's Case.</hi> And for the same Reason, Negative words in an Art of Parliament do not bind this Court. And for this cause two years after, for the enlarging of their Exemption in that behalf, this Charter was purchased and drawn by <hi>the same Attorney General:</hi> And the Citizens have ever since béen quiet till now; so that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent having béen made upon this very occasion, ought in reason to be allowed in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the <hi>Charter</hi> shall not be so Expounded, it will serve for little or nothing. For the Clause of <hi>Exemption</hi> extends to <hi>Criminal Causes</hi> only, and with an Exception of <hi>High Treason.</hi> And therefore this case is not like those cases that are put of General words; which will not extend where the King is party without a special Clause, <hi>Lice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Because in these cases the words have a sufficient Latitude, though restrain'd to causes betwixt <hi>party and party.</hi> So a General Exemption from all <hi>Juries, Assizes, Recognition, &amp;c.</hi> do not extend to a <hi>Writ of Right,</hi> in which <hi>four Knights</hi> Elect, and make the Return in the nature of Iudges, and not the <hi>Sheriff:</hi> Nor to an <hi>Attaint,</hi> as in 34 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 25. <hi>&amp; Marlebr. cap.</hi> 14 because there are extraordinary Iuries in those. But where an Exemption is granted in case of an <hi>Attaint,</hi> there it lies, though after the Iury be impanelled, 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 42. But here the words are such as were intended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> extend to this Court, and to such Causes only as the King is a party in, and therefore ought to receive such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as will make them valid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Although the words, <hi>Licet tangat nos,</hi> are not in the Charter, yet there are words <hi>equivalent,</hi> and which are <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:52142:169"/>
                  <hi>Oxford,</hi> by <hi>King Richard the Second,</hi> whereby was Granted, That the Vice-Chancellor and his Successors should have Conusance of all Pleas moved <hi>in Curiâ Regis,</hi> wherein one of the parties was a Clerk residing in the Vniversity, to be held before him or his Commissary; and it is there held, that those words amount to as much as if it had been expressed, <hi>Licet ipse fuerit pars:</hi> And there, <hi>fol.</hi> 20. <hi>b. Babington</hi> said, that all Liberties and Franchises were Originally in the Crown, and derived from it: And if the King grant a <hi>Flower of the Crown,</hi> such a Grant is <hi>stricti Juris.</hi> From that case I argue to the case in question <hi>à fortiori;</hi> for in our case there are words which include the <hi>King</hi> himself: For in all <hi>Criminal Causes</hi> He is the most proper party, especially in <hi>Indictments</hi> and <hi>Informations,</hi> where he is the <hi>sole party;</hi> and therefore this <hi>Exemption</hi> shall Extend, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Here is an Exception of <hi>High-Treason,</hi> and the Rule is, that <hi>Exceptio firmat regulam in non Exceptis;</hi> as in 14 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 2. a Grant of <hi>Bois</hi> Except <hi>Apple-Trees,</hi> passeth all <hi>other Fruit-Trees,</hi> although they would not have passed but for that <hi>Exception.</hi> So here, the Exception of <hi>Treason</hi> makes the Grant stronger against the King in all other cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is a Rule in Law, That the King's Grants in all cases, where the King is not deceiv'd, shall be expounded <hi>pro Honore Regis;</hi> and so as to make them most effectual, 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 1, 2. A Grant of such an Exemption by a <hi>King,</hi> who is an <hi>Usurper,</hi> shall bind. So in 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 55, 56. such a Grant as this of ours to Citizens, shall extend to every one of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually, tho' not granted to them by their Name of <hi>Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> So 19 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 52. upon the Statute of 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. that a Release made within a County Palatine, of Right to Lands lying out of the County Palatine, shall be tryed out of the County Palatine, does not extend by Equity to an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation sealed within a County Palatine, for the payment of Mony elsewhere; because the Statute being made in restrain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the King's Grant, shall be <hi>stricti Juris.</hi> So here, it is more Honourable for the King to have this Exemption extend to the case in question, and have its full scope and effect; and the rather, because it does not tend to excuse, or any ways give any advantage to Malefactors, who may as well be tryed by <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> or <hi>Nisi prius,</hi> within the City.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Second Point,</hi> I conceive that the City is, in time, to have the benefit of this Exemption allow'd them in this case.</p>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:52142:169"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> They could not come sooner; for it does not appear by the <hi>Venire facias,</hi> whether the Tryal was to be by <hi>Nisi prius</hi> or not; for that appears by the <hi>Distringas,</hi> and not till then: And therefore the proper time to make return of the Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is upon the <hi>Distringas.</hi> And here the Exemption is not from <hi>All Juries,</hi> but from <hi>All Juries out of the City,</hi> so that this case is not like a <hi>General Exemption.</hi> And it is said expressly by <hi>Brown</hi> 2 <hi>Clerk in</hi> 19 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 52. <hi>b.</hi> that in such case the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of <hi>London,</hi> will not return any Issues against the Iurors till the <hi>Distringas</hi> with a <hi>Nisi prius,</hi> which is as much as to say, that there is no néed of claiming the <hi>Exemption</hi> before. And as it would be too soon, and before the Cause were ripe, to claim it sooner, so after the parties have appeared, it would be too late, as appears 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>b.</hi> Where if one appears and pleads his <hi>Exemption,</hi> it is naught till all have appear'd: For if it should be denied that he is a <hi>Citizen,</hi> it must be Tried <hi>immediately.</hi> Vpon a second <hi>Distringas</hi> one appeared and pleaded such an <hi>Exemption</hi> in <hi>Attaint,</hi> and a <hi>Quaere</hi> made of it. But in 34 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 25. 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 42. it is admitted to be good. In 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 20. in Debt against an Alien, he pray'd upon the <hi>Distringas Medietat. Linguae</hi> according to a <hi>Charter,</hi> and it was allowed him after the <hi>Venire facias</hi> returned. And 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 14. after the Priviledge allowed, the party is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to say, that he was not an Alien. But in case of an <hi>Alien,</hi> a Tryal <hi>per medietatem Linguae,</hi> must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 357. <hi>Stamf. Pl. Cor.</hi> 159. And it differs from the Case of 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. aforecited; because there it appear'd upon the <hi>Record</hi> that he was an <hi>Alien,</hi> and not so in the other Case against a Man that is an <hi>Alien,</hi> but not called s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>▪</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Exemption</hi> comes well before the Court up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sheriff's return, to save himself. For if after a <hi>Writ of Allowance</hi> served upon him, and the <hi>Charter</hi> shewn him, he should not return the <hi>Exemption,</hi> an Action upon the Case would lie against him, at the Suit of any person, who being distrained to appear upon a Iury, had right to be <hi>Exempted</hi> by the <hi>Charter:</hi> And the diversity taken in all our Books is▪ that upon the shewing of a Charter-to the Sheriff without a Writ of Allowance, the Sheriff is not obliged to take notice of it; but upon a <hi>Writ of Allowance</hi> he is bound to take notice of it, upon the penalty of being lyable to an Action, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>Co. Mag. Cart.</hi> 130. upon the <hi>Stat. of Marleb. cap.</hi> 14. as the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> observes.</p>
               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:52142:170"/>
               <p>So that upon the whole matter I conceive, that the <hi>Citizens</hi> have a good <hi>Exemption,</hi> and that it could not have béen claimed before, and that it comes properly before the Court upon the return of the Sheriff, and that if the Sheriff had not return'd it, he would have béen lyable to an Action: And therefore he prayed that the Return might be accepted, and the <hi>Priviledge</hi> allowed.</p>
               <p>And the Reason that was given why all <hi>Citizens</hi> were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was this; because an Officer of the Court chose them, the Sheriff shewing him the Frée-holders Book by Order of Court.</p>

               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Easter Term Anno</hi> 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. the <hi>Court</hi> held that this <hi>Priviledge</hi> did not come properly before them, upon the <hi>Sheriff Retum;</hi> but that the Iurors, being Fréemen, ought to demand it severally upon their appearance upon the <hi>Distringas.</hi> And the Sheriff was fined 100 <hi>l.</hi> and afterwards a Iury was returned and appeared without claiming their Priviledge, and Cryed the Cause this Term, and found for the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Fine</hi> set upon the <hi>Sheriff</hi> was <hi>Discharged.</hi>

               <p>Vpon this Case <hi>two Points</hi> were raised, <hi>First,</hi> Whether the <hi>power</hi> here reserved be <hi>well Executed</hi> by making this Mortgage? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Admiting the power not well executed, yet whether or no this Conveyance being made by the Father and Son, for a <hi>valuable Consideration</hi> shall not stand good against the Estate Tail limited to the Heirs Males General of the Son, which was <hi>voluntary;</hi> by vertue of the <hi>Statute of</hi> 27 <hi>Eliz?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Levins pro quer. First,</hi> The <hi>Power</hi> here is <hi>well Executed,</hi> though there be no Recital of it in the Déeds of <hi>Mortgage, Vid.</hi> 6 <hi>Rep. Sir Edward Clere's Case;</hi> and though the Mortgage he by Lease and Release, for the power is <hi>by any Writing, Vid.</hi> 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 31. And though it was Executed only as to part of the Lands, the words of the Reservation being <hi>of All and Singular the Lands, &amp;c.</hi> for such a power may be Executed, part at one time and part at another. And I conceive the power here to be well Executed for these Reasons; <hi>First,</hi> Because this <hi>Mortgage</hi> may properly be called a <hi>Charge</hi> upon the Lands, the word <hi>Charge</hi> being a General word, and extending as well to an Estate of, and in Land it self, as to an Estate charged upon the Land, <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 15. <hi>Warranty</hi> is said to be a Charge: And 50 <hi>Ass.</hi> 5. Lands being seized upon an Extent, is termed a <hi>Charge, Vid. Hob. Rep.</hi> 45. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Co. Rep. Julius Winnington's Case: Dower</hi> and a <hi>Statute</hi> are Charges upon Land, and in <hi>Goldsborough's Rep.</hi> 95, 96. <hi>a Mortgage</hi> is said to be a <hi>Charge,</hi> and in 1 <hi>Inst.</hi> 205. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is within the intent of the power, that Interest should be paid for the <hi>Two thousand pounds,</hi> because Mony cannot be borrow'd without paying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest for it; and the 160 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> is no more than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest for 2000 <hi>l.</hi> at the rate of 8 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> And admitting that it were naught as to the <hi>Interest,</hi> yet it is well for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of the principal sum of <hi>Two thousand pounds.</hi> For if a <hi>Power</hi> be <hi>Executed</hi> more amply than according to the <hi>Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:52142:171"/> yet the Execution is good for so much as is within the power, and void only for the rest: <hi>Vid. Cro.</hi> 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 451, 462. If an Executor Assent to a Legacy upon Condition, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only is void. If an Heir Assign Dower upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Condition only is void.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Second Point</hi> he argued, admitting the Conveyance not to be warranted by the power reserved, that yet it was good by the <hi>Stat. of</hi> 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Father and Son joyning in it, against the Heirs General of the Son: For that Estate, if not Fraudulent, is at <hi>least Voluntary,</hi> for neither the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age nor the Portion does affect that Estate; the Wife being dead without Issue Male, and the Son here in this Case, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Son by the second Venter. And if it be not within the words, yet it is not within the intent of the Act. <hi>Vid. Dyer</hi> 294, 295. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6 <hi>Eliz. Dyer, Churton's Case.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Stevens pro Defendente.</hi> The power here is not well Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. There is a diversity betwéen a power created by the <hi>Party,</hi> and a power given by the <hi>Law:</hi> If created by the Party, it must be strictly pursued, <hi>Vid.</hi> 5 <hi>Rep. Mountjoy's Case,</hi> 8 <hi>Rep. Whitlock' Case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the word <hi>Charge</hi> extends to a <hi>Mortgage. Resp.</hi> In a Déed of Covenant it may, where the words must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded beneficially for the Person, to whom the Covenant is made, but not in case of a Reservation of a power: And here the intent of the Parties appears plainly, to have béen against any such Conveyance; for by this means all the subsequent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states would be divested, which was not the intent of the power, nor could they be Revested again after the <hi>Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Estate limited to the Heirs General of the Son is not Fraudulent, so as to be void against the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagee. It is said in <hi>Twyne's Case,</hi> 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> that the <hi>Stat. of</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> was made in Affirmance of the Common Law, but not the <hi>Stat. of</hi> 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and no Fraud is here found, nor shall it therefore be intended or presumed; as appears 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> in the <hi>Chancellor of Oxford's Case.</hi> This Estate is not within the words of 27 <hi>Eliz. Vid. the Statute.</hi> Nor is it within the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: Although the Statute has a liberal construction, with respect both to Persons and Estates; and has béen construed to extend to one Person and not to another, and to one Estate and not to another. <hi>Valans and Winkfield's Case, B.R. and Sir Rich. Lydal's Case,</hi> 6 <hi>Jac. and Sir John Jacob's being Bromwel and Player's Case, in B. R.</hi> where a Conveyance was adjudged good as to one Person, and void as to another, and good against one Estate, and void against another: yet all powers of Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:52142:172"/> are not within this Law; as a power of Revocation with a limitation or condition precedent: And yet the words of the Statute are general. So a power to make Leases for one and twenty years, though a Feoffment be made afterwards for a valuable Consideration, yet Leases made by vertue of that power, are not within the Statute; for it is a qualified power. And so he concluded <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> The Party to whom this Power was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, might have charged this sum of <hi>Two thousands pounds</hi> upon the Land, in other manner than he has done here: As if he had granted an Estate in the Land, <hi>till the sum of Two thousand pounds had been raised</hi> out of the profits of it; it had béen a good charge, 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>and Thomas and Kemishe's Case, in B. R.</hi> and it had béen a good Execution of his Power. But so large an Estate as is here granted, séems not pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant thereunto, for by this means all the subsequent Estates will be destroyed, which was not the intent of the Parties: And this Conveyance would break through and dislodge them all, which is unreasonable, the Mortgage or being but a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for Life; for the Estate must arise out of his power only, though the Son joyns: For the Son has but an Estate Tail, which will not bear such an Estate as is here conveyed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides it does not appear to have béen the intention of the Parties, that the sum of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> should be raised with <hi>Ten years Interest:</hi> For by the same Reason, 10000 <hi>l.</hi> might be raised by giving a <hi>longer time,</hi> for the payment of the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal:</hi> And the intent here does not appear to have been for the raising any more than 2000 <hi>l.</hi> And it is to be considered, whether or no this Conveyance be good or not for the 2000 <hi>l.</hi> though void for the <hi>Interest?</hi> For a <hi>power</hi> is an <hi>entire</hi> thing. If a man has a power to make Leases for <hi>twenty one years,</hi> and he makes a Lease for <hi>Twenty two years,</hi> it is not good for <hi>Twenty one years</hi> It is also hard to presume <hi>Fraud</hi> in this Case, and there is none found. And the consideration of Marriage, and of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Portion, will run to all the Estates raised by the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, although the Marriage is not concerned in them, so as to make them good against Purchasors and to avoid a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Conveyance. But perhaps there may be good cause for <hi>relief in equity</hi> for the 2000 <hi>l.</hi> though the power was not strictly pursued. <hi>Et Adjornatur.</hi>

                  <hi>Tenant for life</hi> levies a <hi>Fine,</hi> for he has a <hi>Freehold,</hi> and his Fine displaces the Remainders, and therefore an Entry is requisite within <hi>five years</hi> after the death of the Tenant for life. And therefore when a Lessée for years, or at Will, is to levy a Fine, it is usual for the Lessée to make a Feoffment first, to displace the other Estates. But here the Lease for years is antecedent to the Estate of the Lessor, who levies the Fine, and he has a Fréehold expectant upon the Lease, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to it. If there be Tenant for life, Remainder for years, Remainder in Fée to the Remainder-man for years; and the Remainder-man for years levies a Fine, the Estate for life will not be barr'd by this Fine, as hath been adjudged: But it was held in the same case, That a Lease for years in possession would have been barred, <hi>quod non credo.</hi> And the reason of <hi>Blundell's Case</hi> holds here, that a man shall not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seised against his Will. And a <hi>Fine</hi> with five years <hi>Non-claim</hi> must bar an Estate precedent to the Fine, not subsequent to it. And there is here a <hi>Privity</hi> betwixt the Lessor and the Lessee, and therefore the Fine shall not bar; as in case of a <hi>Mortgage,</hi> where the Mortgagor continuing in possession levies a Fine. And in the <hi>Dutchess of Richmond's Case</hi> in <hi>C. B.</hi> this very Case was adjudged <hi>in terminis</hi> for two Reasons; <hi>First,</hi> By reason of the <hi>privity</hi> betwixt the persons: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because the Lessor was in the nature of a <hi>Tenant at Will,</hi> and there was a <hi>Mutual confidence</hi> betwixt the parties. If he be Tenant for life, the Remainder for life▪ the Remainder for life the Remainder in Fée to the first Tenant for life in Remainder, who levies a Fine; this is adjudged to be a <hi>Forfeiture,</hi> but that it operates <hi>no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing; Gallant's Case.</hi> And although in this case the <hi>Lessor</hi> be <hi>estopp'd,</hi> yet that's nothing to the <hi>Lessee.</hi> There was one <hi>Heale's Case</hi> to this effect, <hi>viz. A.</hi> convey'd Lands to <hi>B.</hi> in Fée▪ with a Covenant to make further assurance: Afterwards <hi>B.</hi> leases to <hi>A.</hi> for <hi>forty years,</hi> and then <hi>A.</hi> makes further assurance upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; this bars and conveys the Lease for years, unless there were some precedent agreement to the contrary: But if there had béen any such precedent agreement, then they held that it would have operated only in <hi>Confirmation</hi> and <hi>Corroboration</hi> of the Lease, and would not have destroyed it. <hi>Et Adjornatur.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>UPon a <hi>Bill in Equity</hi> it appear'd, that <hi>Sir George Benion</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(5)"/> being the <hi>King's Receiver,</hi> had assign'd a Debt to the King; and upon the Plea to the Bill this Question arose, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether or no a Debt due to a Debtor of the Assignor might be seized, to satisfie the King's Debt? And <hi>Auditor Povey's Case, Co. Jurisdict. of Courts, p.</hi> 115. was cited, that it could not in case of a Det in Aid; no more can it here, because great Inconvenience would ensue upon such Seizures; <hi>viz.</hi> That a Debt in the <hi>third, fourth,</hi> or <hi>fifth degree</hi> would be seized, and so <hi>in infinitum:</hi> And great prejudice would accrue to the Subject hereby, for whereas before only a Moiety of his Lands were liable upon a Iudgment, now all would be seized. And whereas Executors are not liable to Debts upon simple Contracts, here they would be liable, and that though they had discharged themselves of their Assets in the payment of other Debts; which would be very mischievous. But against this was cited <hi>Lane's Rep.</hi> 112. And the Rules of Court, <hi>Hill.</hi> 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. were read, for the preventing of Inconveniences, in such cases for the future.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> Such <hi>Assignments</hi> are usually and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly made for the benefit of the <hi>King's Debtor,</hi> and we take notice of them as such; and for this purpose we have a <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> which was not anciently Granted, but for the benefit of the <hi>King</hi> himself only. And, as hath béen urged, the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences would be very great, if upon such Assignments such Seizures might be made. <hi>Et Adjornatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in the same Term, upon hearing the Directions under the <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> directed to the Court in 12 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> which prohibit such Seizures, <hi>Process was stay'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And afterwards in <hi>Easter Term, Anno decimo nono Car.</hi> 2. it was moved again: And the Orders made <hi>Hill.</hi> 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Lib Decret.</hi> 340. were considered. And it was urged, that the Assignment in this case was in <hi>November</hi> 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rules in <hi>Hill.</hi> 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. and that those Rules were made for the future only, and consequently did not extend to the Case in question: And that in the time of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. before those Rules were made, it was usual (as appears by many Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents) for Lands and Goods of a Debtor to the King's Debtor, to be seized and extended in case of such an Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:52142:175"/> And to <hi>Auditor Povey's Case</hi> it was answered, That that Case was in 13 <hi>Jac. Regis,</hi> which was after the <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> made and directed to the Court in 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of such Mischiefs. Which <hi>Privy Seal</hi> determined with the King's Death; and there were no Orders or Rules given out afterwards till <hi>Hill.</hi> 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. and therefore the usual course that had obtained before 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> was put in Vre in <hi>King Charles</hi> his time, till the Rules of <hi>Hill.</hi> 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. And that usual course was, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> Those <hi>Rules</hi> had no further intent, than to provide for the satisfying of the <hi>King's own Debts,</hi> and not for the satisfying of Debts owing to the <hi>King's Debtor or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countant,</hi> which would be extreamly inconvenient: For at that rate, if a man were indebted to the King in <hi>One hundred pounds,</hi> and another person indebted to the <hi>King's Debtor</hi> in a <hi>Thousand pounds,</hi> and a third person indebted to him in <hi>Ten thousand pounds:</hi> These several Debtors should have the benefit of the <hi>King's Prerogative,</hi> against the Lands and Goods for the recovering of their several Debts. There would be no Inconvenience if the <hi>King's own Debt</hi> were so levied, though in the Tenth degrée; for then the <hi>King's Prerogative</hi> would be exerted for the satisfying of his <hi>own Debt</hi> only; and there is no question, but the <hi>King's own Debt</hi> may be so levied. But to make the <hi>King's Prerogative</hi> instrumental, and become a stale to satisfie other men's Debts, would be unreasonable, inconvenient and mischievous to the Subject; and so it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> made in 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> But all the <hi>Court</hi> agreed, that in this case, <hi>Pemberton,</hi> Debtor to the <hi>Lord St. John,</hi> Debtor to the Assigner <hi>Sir George Benion,</hi> should be liable:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because the Assignment was before the Rules made in 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. and according to former Presidents in Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because the case here being of a <hi>Debt assign'd,</hi> the <hi>Lord St. John</hi> is but the first Debtor, and <hi>Pemberton</hi> the second; and so not within the Rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It appears by the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth Rules,</hi> that the <hi>third Debtor</hi> is within the Rules, but no Debtor in a more remote Degree: And therefore the Plea was overrul'd.</p>

                  <hi>LIonel Copley Esq;</hi> prayed a <hi>Prohibition</hi> to the Archdeacon's-Court at <hi>Doncaster</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> upon an <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> against him for not receiving the Sacrament in his own Parish-Church, grounded upon a Presentment made by the Churchwardens in 1664. The ground of his <hi>Prayer</hi> was because he had alledged and shewn to the <hi>Official</hi> a <hi>Certificate,</hi> that he had taken it in another place; and the <hi>Court</hi> held, that the <hi>Ecclesiastical Court</hi> had conusance of the Cause, and had good cause to proceed upon the Presentment <hi>primâ facie,</hi> because the party had not received the Communion there, <hi>viz.</hi> in his own Parish-Church; and that it lies on his part to prove, that he received it elsewhere. And if he did really receive it elsewhere, it is a good plea for him in the Ecclesiastical Court; upon the <hi>refusal</hi> of which plea a <hi>Prohibition</hi> lies, but not else. And because it did not appear to the Court, that <hi>Mr. Copley</hi> had pleaded it in the <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> nor was there any <hi>Affidavit</hi> made of it; For that Reason the Court denyed to grant a <hi>Prohibition</hi> at that time, but would advise.</p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Trinity Term▪</hi> He suggested, that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> that he took the Sacrament else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and that the Court had refused to admit of the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and thereupon he now pray'd a <hi>Prohibition.</hi> But the <hi>Attorney</hi> and <hi>Solicitor General</hi> moved, that no <hi>Prohibition</hi> ought to go out in this case, because the matter is purely <hi>Spiritual</hi> and of <hi>Ecclesiastical Cognizance;</hi> and no <hi>Temporal Matter</hi> arises in the Cause. And if the <hi>Spiritual Court</hi> does not do Iustice in it, an <hi>Appeal</hi> lies. They alledged farther, That if the <hi>Original Cause</hi> be of <hi>Spiritual Cognizance,</hi> and some incident dependent Matter arise, as a Lease or Livery of Seisin, which in their own nature are of <hi>Temporal Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,</hi> and such Matter be pleaded there and <hi>refused;</hi> yet a <hi>Prohibition</hi> ought not be granted; and for that they quoted 12 <hi>Co. Rep. Robert's Case:</hi> And that in no case whatsoever a <hi>Prohibition</hi> shall be granted for any <hi>Temporal Matter</hi> arising in a Cause, before <hi>Refusal,</hi> where the <hi>Original Cause</hi> belongs to their Iurisdiction, but only in the case of a <hi>Modus. Vide</hi> 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Rep. the Bishop of Winchester's Case;</hi> and the reason of that is, because the <hi>Court Christian</hi> does not allow of any <hi>Modus;</hi> and because the <hi>Modus</hi> it self, if there be any, may and ought to be sued for there.</p>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:52142:176"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron:</hi> He denied the ground that they went upon, and said, That if the Law were so, then if a Suit were well commenced there, the Temporal Courts could not determine any Matter arising in it, which is not true; and said, That their <hi>Refusal</hi> of a Plea that contained Matter of Temporal Cognizance, had always béen admitted to be a good Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion for a <hi>Prohibition.</hi> But the difficulty here was (he said) that all the Matter both of the Plea and the Libel, was <hi>Spiritual</hi> and of <hi>Ecclesiastical Cognizance;</hi> and that that Court had a Iurisdiction therein appeared by the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> confirmed by Act of Parliament, whereby it is appointed, that thrée times in a year, of which <hi>Easter</hi> to be one, All persons shall receive the Communion. And hereupon <hi>Adjornatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And afterwards, being moved again, the <hi>Court</hi> denied to grant a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> because the Cause was purely <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and they proper Iudges of the <hi>Certificate,</hi> and if they refused the Plea, an <hi>Appeal</hi> would lie; but no <hi>Prohibition.</hi> Moreover they said, that the <hi>Allegation</hi> in the <hi>Certificate,</hi> that he had received the <hi>Communion alibi,</hi> was not sufficient, because by the <hi>Rubrick</hi> he ought to receive it <hi>three times a year,</hi> and so the effect of the <hi>Libel</hi> not answered.</p>

                  <hi>Mr. Trevor pro quer'</hi> made several Points in the Case. <hi>First,</hi> He urged that by the bargain and sale, the Tenant for Life had departed with all his Estate, so that afterwards he had no such Power, as to make a Lease for 31 years.

               <p>
                  <hi>Serjeant Newdigate pro Defendent.</hi> Here is a good power, both to make a Lease and to make a Ioynture, and the one does not destroy the other: They both arise out of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Estate, and not out of the Estate of the Tenant for life. But is a power Collateral to his Estate, and therefore is not destroyed by a conveyance made by him; as was adjudged in <hi>Phitton's Case,</hi> that a Lease and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease destroyed not such a power, and especially where the Tenant for Life passes away only such an Estate as he may lawfully pass, and by a bargain and sale no more passes from him, than he may lawfully convey; nor does such a conveyance make any displacing of Estates.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> Here have béen many material Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons stirred on the Plaintiffs behalf. <hi>First,</hi> Whether these powers are well raised? And it should séem that they are; because the Estates to be limited by them, shall take effect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their precedency; and there may very well be a resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of the term for years, left unexpired after the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ioynture; which sufficeth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether or no the power be well Executed, as to the Lease for 31 years? And the power seems to be well Executed by the second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, tho' not by the first, <hi>viz.</hi> by the bargain and sale, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was neither made for a <hi>Joynture,</hi> nor was it a bargain and sale for 31 years; but passed away all his Estate and his Reversion in Fée; and so was not pursuant to his power, and therefore the power not well Executed by that conveyance. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether here be a good <hi>claim</hi> made to avoid the <hi>Fine?</hi> But there needs no claim in the case; because this Lease is only a <hi>future Interest,</hi> and therefore not touched by the Fine. <hi>Vid.</hi> 5th <hi>Report, Saffyn's Case;</hi> and if it were requisite, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by his <hi>direction,</hi> that ought to enter, which is found here, suffices in a <hi>Special Verdict. Fourthly,</hi> Whether this bargain and sale have destroyed the power. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Whether it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by the Reconveyance? As to these two Points, it will be hard to say, that the Reconveyance has destroyed it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not the Act of the party that had the power. And it is hard to say, that the bargain and sale has done it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the power is Collateral, and the Estate to be limited does not arise out of the Tenancy for life, but out of the first Estate. It would be much clearer and a stronger case, if the Tenant for life had a power generally to make a Lease for years, to say that the Lease should arise out of his Estate, than this of ours is, in which the Lease for years is not to commence, till after the Death of the Tenant for life; and therefore cannot be incident to his Estate. And in <hi>Noy's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,</hi> it is held that a Covenant to stand seized in Fée, does not destroy such a power: Though that may be questionable, because the whole Estate is there disturbed; whereas the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and sale here displaces nothing. And if the Bargainor had a power of Revocation, he might well execute it after the executing this Conveyance. But he said, he would not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Opinion in the Case. <hi>Et Adjurnatur.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Rainesford pro Defendente.</hi> The sole Question here is, whether this Lease for 31 years be well made or not? The Ioynture is out of doors, for that is barr'd by the Fine, and the Collateral Warranty, in the Fine does not bar the Issue in Tail, because he is under Age. So that the question is single, and concerns the Lease for years only; <hi>viz.</hi> whether the power to make a Lease for 31 years, to commence after the Death of the Tenant for life, be well executed or not? And here are two things to be considered. <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>bargain and sale,</hi> and the consequences thereof. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Reconveyance by Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offment,</hi> and the consequences of that. As for the bargain and sale, that does not displace any remainders limited to other persons. So that notwithstanding it, the power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and nothing is passed away by it, but what the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life might lawfully pass. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Reconvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by Feoffment that in deed divests all the remainders and makes the Feoffée to be in of a new Estate, 1 <hi>Rep. Chud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh's Case,</hi> 10 <hi>Rep. Seymor's Case.</hi> And it may be doubted, whether or no the power be not thereby suspended, till the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states he recontinued by an Entry? But I hold it is not: <hi>First,</hi> It is Collateral to the Estate of the Tenant for life, not being to commence till after his Estate be determined: And therefore it cannot be destroyed by a Feoffment, <hi>Vid. Albany's Case,</hi> 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> and <hi>Digge's Case, ibidem.</hi> And it is the same case then as where the power is in a Stranger; <hi>Vid.</hi> 8 <hi>Rep. Whitlock's Case.</hi> And the Estate here is Revested by a Reentry. And if a Tenant for life assigns over, that does not obstruct his power of making a Lease, to commence after his Death: For a Collateral power remains notwithstanding the Estates be disturbed; as in 15 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 11. 1 <hi>Rep. Albany's Case,</hi> and <hi>Digge's Case, Co. Lit.</hi> 170. A power given to Executors or to Feoffees to sell, remains after the Estate is disturbed. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> The Estate here is <hi>recontinued</hi> by the Entry of the Tenant in Tail, after the Death of Tenant for life, which is found here by the Verdict. <hi>Vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Rep. Chudleigh's Case. Objection,</hi> The power cannot be said to be Collateral with respect to the Remainder in Fée, which was in the Tenant for life, and passed by the bargain and sale. <hi>Resp.</hi> There is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity betwixt a <hi>Condition</hi> and a <hi>Power.</hi> A <hi>Condition</hi> cannot be apportioned, but a <hi>Power</hi> may, for one is not favoured in Law as the other is: <hi>Vid. Co. Litt.</hi> 215. 237. <hi>Hob.</hi> 312. And as long as the Estates tail remain, the power shall be déem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Collateral, but not after they are determined. In this case they continue as yet. And concluded <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Turner pro Querente.</hi> There are two questions in this Case. <hi>First.</hi> Whether this power be well created? And I hold it is. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether it be well Executed? And I hold it is not, because it is destroyed by the bargain and sale; nor is it <hi>Collateral;</hi> if it were, it would not be destroyed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Albany's Case,</hi> and <hi>Digges Case,</hi> 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> But here it savors of the Land. If a Feoffor had reserved such a power originally, it would not have béen held to be <hi>Collateral:</hi> And though the Land do not pass from him that has such a power, yet if such person have an Estate in the Land, the power is not Collateral, <hi>Co. Lit. Cond. last leaf.</hi> And it might be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, if the power were held to be <hi>Collateral;</hi> for then if the Tenant for life should grant a Rent charge, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards make a Lease, &amp;c. he would avoid his own Act. But because it savors of the Land, it is gone by the bargain and sale, and passes together with the Land, and amounts to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation by reason of the Estate in fée Expectant. As in 15 <hi>Jac.</hi> 2 <hi>Cro. Dutton and Ingram's Case:</hi> If Tenant in Tail, remainder to him in Fée, grant a Rent in Fée, the Rent continues after the Expiration of the Estate Tail, and the Grant works by way of Confirmation, by reason of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder in Fée; and the Grant purports an Estate in Fée, tho' it be not really such; so here. And concluded <hi>pro Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron pro Defendente.</hi> The Fine and <hi>Non-claim</hi> do not bar this <hi>future Interest,</hi> not being here displaced and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a <hi>Right.</hi> And the powers of making a <hi>Joynture</hi> and a <hi>Lease,</hi> as aforesaid, are consistent: For during the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Ioynture, the Lease shall not take effect in point of Interest, but shall go on in time, and the residue of the term that remains unexpired, after the Death of the Ioyntress shall take effect in interest: And no more. The only que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion then is, Whether or no the power to make a Lease for one and thirty years be destroyed? <hi>First,</hi> Powers to raise Estates are either <hi>simply Collateral</hi> (as where a party that has such power has not, nor ever had any Estate in the Land: As where such power is reserved to a Stranger, and there it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be destroyed by such Stranger, because it is no more than a bare nomination) or <hi>not simply Collateral:</hi> And these latter are of <hi>two sorts. First, Appendant and annexed to the Estate; Secondly, In gross.</hi> A power of the first sort is, where Tenant for life has a power to make Leases for one and twenty years or thrée lives: Such a power is <hi>not simply Collateral.</hi> For if such a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant charge the Land with a Rent, and then execute his power, the charge shall not be defeated whilst he lives, <hi>Latche's Rep.</hi>
                  <pb n="416" facs="tcp:52142:181"/> So if he had before Covenanted to stand seized to the use of another; because the power in that case is annexed to the Estate. But where the power does not <hi>fall within the Estate,</hi> as here the Tenant for life has a power to make an Estate, which is not to begin till after his own Estate determined, such power is not appendant or annexed to the Land, but is a power <hi>in gross;</hi> Because the Estate for life has no concern in it. And yet such a power may by apt words be destroyed by Release, or by a Fine or Feoffment, which carry away, and include all things relating to the Land: But an Assignment of <hi>totum statum suum,</hi> or other Alteration of the Estate for lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, does not affect such a power; because it is a power <hi>in gross.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we are to consider, whether, as this case is, the power be destroyed? Two things have béen urged, to prove the power gone and destroyed. <hi>First,</hi> The bargain and sale. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Feoffment and Reconveyance to the Tenant for life.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>first</hi> of these Objections there are two things. <hi>First,</hi> The Tenant for life has passed away his <hi>Estate for life. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> He has passed, away his <hi>Reversion in fee,</hi> by <hi>bargain and sale. Resp.</hi> To the <hi>first Objection,</hi> the <hi>bargain and sale</hi> does not touch the Remainders in Tail; but the Estate <hi>for life,</hi> and the <hi>Remainder in fee</hi> only. And the power here is not annexed to the Land, but is a <hi>power in gross.</hi> If the Tenant for life in this case, had a power of Revocation and should make a Lease, that would not destroy his power, because no is Estate displaced by it. And in <hi>Hughe's Rep. in</hi> 27, 28. <hi>Eliz. Cas.</hi> 40. a bargain and sale does not pass away, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a <hi>Contingent use</hi> in the Bargainor: But a Feoffment or a Fine, would transfer it. And for Answer to the <hi>Second Objection,</hi> grounded upon the Remainder in fée being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, I hold that if the Remainder in fée should come in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Bargainée would not hold the Land charged with this Lease, because the Interest of the Remainder in fée would support it, and it is a power annexed to that Estate, but till then it is a <hi>Collateral</hi> power, and <hi>in gross quoad</hi> the Remainders in Tail, which are precedent to it. But that is not our case; for the Question here is not, how the Law would have béen in case the Remainder in fée had béen the only Estate in being.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection,</hi> If the Fée-simple be discharged, then the mean Estates are so too: As in case of a <hi>Seignory</hi> or <hi>Condition,</hi> if the Fée be discharged, the mean Estates are so too. <hi>Resp.</hi> A <hi>Power</hi> is <hi>Apportionable,</hi> but a <hi>Seignory</hi> or a <hi>Condition</hi> is not. As a <hi>Warranty,</hi> tho' it be destroyed as to the Fée-simple, yet it continues annex't to the mean Estates. This was <hi>Alderman
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:52142:181"/> Garraway's Case;</hi> A Lease for an hundred years being made, the Reversion was granted for life, and the Lessée granted his Estate to him in the Reversion in Fée; and it was held, that the Lease for years was not destroyed by méeting with the Fée, because by possibility the Lease for life might out-last the Term. So here there is a possibility that the Reversion in Fée may come in possession; and yet the Power is not destroy'd by it. So if a Grantée in Fée of a Rent purchase a Remainder in Fée of the Land depending upon an Estate tail, the Rent is not hereby extinct; because there is but a Possibility of the Remainder in Fée coming ever into possession. <hi>Vide Noys Rep. Bramall and Cook's Case, Pasch.</hi> 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> No more in this case shall the Possibility of the Remainder in Fée coming into possession, destroy the Power.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Question is, Whether the Feoffment has destroy'd it, or no? And I hold not; because it never was in the Feoffor, nor reserved to him. But there is no Feoffment here found, but only a Conveyance from the Bargainée to the Tenant for life, with these words, <hi>viz. Grant, Bargain, Sell, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease, Enfeoff</hi> and <hi>Confirm.</hi> But admitting the Power not destroyed, <hi>causa qua suprà;</hi> yet here is a forfeiture of the Estate for life, and a Displacing of all the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> No; because here <hi>William</hi> had a <hi>Right</hi> to make such a Lease, which is sufficent to support the Power. As if Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life, Remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>J. S.</hi> be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seised, the Right remaining in the Tenant for life is sufficient to support the Contingent Remainder: And by the Entry of Tenant for life, it is reduced together with the Estate. So here, If the Tenant for life had been disseised, and then had made such a Lease, and had entred, this would have reduced the Right to an Actual Estate. And here it is found, that the Tenant in tail Entred, which reduceth all the Estates and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, and by consequence the Lease for 31 years: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>

               <p>UPon <hi>English Bill</hi> the case was, that <hi>Thomas Pride,</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(5)"/> of <hi>Treason</hi> for the Death of King <hi>Charles the First,</hi> by the late Act of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. by his Will in writing, made before <hi>April</hi> 1659, had Devised certain Lands to be sold for the payment of his Debts, and made his Wife and his Son Executors, and that they should sée his Will performed in every particular; and died. His Executors convey'd the Lands in question over to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Pincheon,</hi> in trust, for the payment of the Testator's Debts: And whether or no these Lands should be liable in the Trustées hands to the payment of his Debts, or should be forfeited by the said <hi>Act of Attainder,</hi> was the Question.</p>
               <p>And it was said by <hi>Hale Chief Baron,</hi> that if there had been an <hi>Interest</hi> devised to the Executors, it would have prevented the Lands from <hi>Escheating;</hi> as 49 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Isabel Goodcheapes Case.</hi> And it has been held, That if a man devise that his Lands shall be <hi>sold by his Executors,</hi> for payment of his Debts, that that will give the Executors an <hi>Interest,</hi> as well as if he had devised his Lands <hi>to his Executors</hi> to be sold.

               <p>And afterwards the <hi>Court</hi> held, that the Lands might well be sold, and that they are within the <hi>Proviso</hi> of the said <hi>Act of Attainder,</hi> whether it be a <hi>Power,</hi> or an <hi>Interest</hi> that passeth by the <hi>Will;</hi> and that the payment of <hi>Debts</hi> is a good Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and that if one of them refused, the other might sell by the <hi>Statute of</hi> 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and though but a <hi>Power</hi> was devised,

                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Office</hi> is Assignable, by reason of the word <hi>Assigns</hi> in the <hi>Patent.</hi> But else it would not have béen Assignable, being an Office of <hi>Trust,</hi> which concerns the <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue:</hi> Some <hi>Offices</hi> are in their nature <hi>Assignable,</hi> without the word <hi>Assigns,</hi> and some not. As a <hi>Parkership</hi> is an Office As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signable in its nature, being an Office of <hi>Profit:</hi> Others are not, <hi>viz.</hi> Offices of <hi>publick Trust,</hi> as this here is. <hi>vide</hi> 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 3. 19 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 34. 11 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 1, 2. 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 14. so <hi>Offices</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to men, their <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Assigns</hi> are <hi>Assignable:</hi> As 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> 97. <hi>b.</hi> admitted in case of a <hi>Shrivalty.</hi> And there is no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in such case; for if assigned to an unfit person, the <hi>Court</hi> can refuse to admit him. <hi>vide Dyer</hi> 150. 11 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It cannot be assigned in this case, because then the intention of the <hi>Patent</hi> will be frustrated; which is, that Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties shall be given before any exercise of the <hi>Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> the Assignée may and must perform that, <hi>vide Lit.</hi> 97. <hi>and</hi> 5 <hi>Rep. Goodale's Case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Assignment</hi> is good before <hi>Admission;</hi> for Admission relates to the <hi>Exercise</hi> of the Office only, and not to the <hi>Interest</hi> in it; and the <hi>Interest</hi> passeth by the Grant: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it is in Cases, where the Admission gives the very <hi>Interest</hi> it self. As in case of the <hi>Prothonotaries,</hi> or of <hi>a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-hold,</hi> 39 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 34. 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is no <hi>Forfeiture</hi> in this case, for there is no exercise of the <hi>Office</hi> before <hi>Admission:</hi> And the entry into the House is not an entermedling in the <hi>Office:</hi> For that is no Execution of, or Entry upon the <hi>Office,</hi> but upon a thing that is appendant to the <hi>Office, Vid. Pl. Com.</hi> 178. <hi>b.</hi> 169. 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 33. 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 18. <hi>Conditions</hi> that divest▪ Estates are taken <hi>strictly,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Admitting there were a <hi>Forfeiture,</hi> yet a <hi>Scire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias,</hi> or <hi>finding an Office</hi> is requisite, <hi>Vid.</hi> 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> 95. 96. <hi>Pl.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Verdict cannot supply this defect, because, <hi>First,</hi> Neither the <hi>King</hi> nor the <hi>Patentee</hi> are parties to it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Verdict against a Tenant for life, is no Evidence against him in the Reversion. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Law be so; the party grieved is without remedy, which he may have if an <hi>Office</hi> were found; for that is <hi>Traversable.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Heneage Finch Sollicitor General pro Defendente.</hi> There are 2 principal Points in the case. <hi>First,</hi> Whether this <hi>Office</hi> were <hi>Assignable,</hi> if there had béen no such <hi>Proviso. Secondly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Proviso</hi> alter the case?</p>
               <p>The <hi>first Question,</hi> has four things in it to be considered. <hi>First,</hi> Whether the Office would have béen Assignable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word <hi>Assigns</hi> in the <hi>Patent? Secondly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Habendum</hi> to his <hi>Assigns,</hi> had made it Assignable? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether an Assignment be good before <hi>Admission? Fourthly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Assignee</hi> ought to be <hi>admitted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>second Question,</hi> has four things likewise to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. <hi>First,</hi> Whether the <hi>Proviso</hi> be an <hi>implied</hi> or an <hi>express Condition? Secondly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Assignee</hi> be bound by it? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The consequence of that: And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is to be made upon the <hi>Patent</hi> taken altogether?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Office</hi> is not Assignable without the word <hi>Assigns,</hi> because it is an <hi>Office</hi> of a great and a <hi>publick trust, Dyer</hi> 30. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Habendum</hi> does not alter the case, it being in the <hi>King's</hi> Case; for it would be inconvenient, that the <hi>King</hi> should have an <hi>Officer</hi> in such a place, put upon him against his will, 11 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 1. 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 84. and <hi>Habendum</hi> to the Grantée and his <hi>Assigns,</hi> is no other than if it had béen to him and his <hi>Heirs,</hi> which would have béen <hi>Void,</hi> 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 84. <hi>per Bryan. Hill.</hi> 1652. <hi>B. R. in Hatton's Case,</hi> the Office of a <hi>Garbler</hi> granted with power to make a Deputy, does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to an Assignée, because an Office of <hi>Trust.</hi> There is no president of an Assignment of such an <hi>Office.</hi> Nor was there any such word as <hi>Assigns</hi> in the <hi>Patents</hi> of them, till the time of <hi>R. Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Assignment before <hi>admittance</hi> is <hi>Void:</hi> For where an <hi>Office</hi> requires <hi>skill,</hi> admittance is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; for else there can be no examination of the Officer's abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, <hi>vide</hi> 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. and if it were otherwise, the Assignée might have a good Title, though the Assignor had none himself, <hi>Vide
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:52142:186"/> Hob.</hi> 148. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Stat. de Scaccario</hi> requires admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (sée the words of it) before Entry into the House.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>second Question. First,</hi> A <hi>Proviso</hi> is <hi>modus donationis,</hi> and more than the Law implies. <hi>Vide</hi> 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1. and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso</hi> here varies from the Statute in thrée respects. <hi>First,</hi> The sufficiency of the Sureties is tryable by the <hi>Patent,</hi> by the <hi>Lord Treasurer:</hi> There by the <hi>Court. Secondly, Two</hi> Sureties are all the Act requires: Here are more. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Treasurer</hi> is to determin what sum the Officer and his Sureties are to become bound in; By the <hi>Stat.</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> is to determin it. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Assignee</hi> is not in this case bound by the <hi>Condition. First,</hi> The <hi>Proviso</hi> shall be taken <hi>strictly</hi> in the <hi>King's</hi> Case; and an Assignée is not named: <hi>Dyer</hi> 65, <hi>and Moor's Rep. Pl.</hi> 4. <hi>Anderson's Rep.</hi> 124. <hi>Latch</hi> 16. <hi>Dyer</hi> 66. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Assignée cannot perform it. <hi>Vide</hi> 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Condition de Recognisance.</hi> And the <hi>Stat. de Scaccario</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends only to Officers. Also he is not lyable in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the <hi>King</hi> requires by it. <hi>Third</hi> Consideration is the consequence of this, which is very prejudicial to the <hi>King;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Court</hi> will not permit it. <hi>Vide Hob. Rep.</hi> 335. <hi>Vide</hi> 5 <hi>Rep. Knight's Case,</hi> 7 <hi>Rep. Englefield's Case, Yel.</hi> 207. 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 24. 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 34. <hi>and</hi> 4 <hi>Car. Sir William Brockman's Case, in Scaccario.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>fourth Consideration;</hi> the <hi>Proviso</hi> must be so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as to be a qualification of the Grant, and the power of Assigning to take place, after Security given and not before. And <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 170. is not Law, as appears <hi>Co.</hi> 4. <hi>Rep. Dumport's Case,</hi> and <hi>Mich.</hi> 1655. <hi>B. R. Fox's Case,</hi> such a <hi>Proviso</hi> was adjudged to be good, against that Authority in <hi>Hob.</hi> and this Office is not in its own nature Assignable: Otherwise, if it were such. And concluded <hi>pro Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Easter Term</hi> 19 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. The <hi>Defendant</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a Writ <hi>de Rege Inconsulto,</hi> directed to this <hi>Court</hi> to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease proceeding, after the case had béen debated on both sides, and that the <hi>Court</hi> were ready to deliver their Iudgments; which Writ was grounded upon an Inquisition, and a seisure of the Office into the <hi>King's</hi> hands for a forfeiture, and a Plea to the Inquisition, and a Iudgment thereupon in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> for the <hi>King:</hi> Which Inquisition was taken after the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Verdict, and the Arguments in the case; and the <hi>Court</hi> allowed of the Writ <hi>de bene esse,</hi> and gave a day to shew cause, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:52142:187"/>
               <p>The Writ contained and set forth the <hi>Patent</hi> of the 29 <hi>of Jan.</hi> 14 <hi>Car.</hi> By which <hi>Patent,</hi> the Office of one of the <hi>four Tellers</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> was granted to <hi>Arthur Squib Junior,</hi> in Reversion, <hi>Habendum</hi> to him and his <hi>Assigns</hi> for his life, to be exercised by him or his Deputy with all profits, Fées and regards thereunto belonging; with a <hi>Proviso</hi> not to exercise the said Office, till he should have given sufficient Security, with Sureties by Recognisance or Obligation, such as the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer or Chancellor</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> should think fit for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Accounts; That on the 28 <hi>of May</hi> 1658. <hi>Arthur Squib Senior,</hi> one of the <hi>Tellers</hi> died, and that thereupon <hi>Arthur Squib Junior</hi> claimed the said Office, and the profits thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing. That on the 14 <hi>of Sept.</hi> 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. An Office was found before <hi>Sir Anthony Jackson</hi> and others Commissioners upon Oath, that the said <hi>Arthur Junior</hi> had not exercised the said <hi>Office,</hi> nor taken the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and that yet he had taken Fées belonging to the Office, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to 113 <hi>l.</hi> without taking the Oath for due Execution of the Office. That the 17 <hi>of April</hi> 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Edward Squib</hi> came and pleaded to this Inquisition, as <hi>Assignee</hi> of the said <hi>Arthur Squib Junior,</hi> that on the 21 <hi>of Feb.</hi> 1653, the said <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Junior,</hi> had assigned over to him the said Office, with the profits thereunto belonging, and that <hi>Arthur Squib Junior</hi> is yet alive. That upon this Plea Iudgment was given in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Chancery,</hi> that the said Office was forfeited, and that it should be seized into the <hi>King</hi> hands: And that the <hi>King</hi> is informed, that there is an <hi>Ejectment</hi> depending in this <hi>Court</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the said parties, <hi>ut suprà,</hi> for a House belonging to the said <hi>Office,</hi> upon the demise of the said <hi>Edward Squib;</hi> and thereupon required the <hi>Court</hi> not to proceed in the cause, <hi>Rege Inconsulto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Question was, whether this Writ should be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or not; and whether the <hi>Court</hi> might procéed, this <hi>Writ</hi> notwithstanding?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hardres</hi> for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in the Action, conceived the Writ ought not to be allowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This Writ is in the nature of an <hi>Aid-prayer.</hi> 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> 17. <hi>a. Ann Bedingfield's Case.</hi> And it is there called a <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectè agatis.</hi> Now it is a constant rule in our Books, that there shall be no <hi>Aid-prayer</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> can receive no prejudice nor mischief; and therefore it is adjudged, 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 1. that if the <hi>King</hi> commits the custody of a <hi>Gard,</hi> and the Committee be impleaded, that he shall not have <hi>Aid</hi> of the <hi>King:</hi> Because the <hi>King</hi> loses nothing: Though <hi>Livery</hi> be to be sued out of the <hi>King's</hi> Hands.

<pb n="429" facs="tcp:52142:187"/> and so are all the Books, that <hi>Aid</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> shall not be. but where the <hi>King</hi> is in danger of receiving a loss, &amp;c. or where the <hi>King's</hi> Tenant has a Warranty. 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 56. 43 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 3. 48 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 18. 49 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 6. 24 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 6. 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 28. 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 11. 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 19. 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 86.

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>b.</hi> 11. <hi>b.</hi> In <hi>Croft's Case;</hi> In an <hi>Assize</hi> brought for the Office of Kéeper of <hi>Woodstock-Park,</hi> upon a Grant made by <hi>King Ed.</hi> 4.

                  </gap>t, by Virtue of a Grant made by <hi>King Hen.</hi> 7. and prayed <hi>Aid</hi> and had it, though it was objected, that both parties claimed by Vertue of the <hi>King's</hi> Grant; and so the <hi>King</hi> at no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> It appears by the Book in that case, that the <hi>King</hi> was bound by <hi>Warranty</hi> to make recompence; and that was the cause why <hi>Aid</hi> was allowed; but there is no such thing in our case. And upon the same reason in 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> 16. <hi>b. Ann Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingfield's Case,</hi> this very Writ of <hi>Rege Inconsulto,</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed in a Writ of <hi>Dower,</hi> brought against an Heir after his full Age, who had béen in Ward to the <hi>King.</hi> Nor is the <hi>King</hi> here at any prejudice, both the claims of both Parties af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the <hi>King's</hi> Title; nor can the <hi>King</hi> himself take the profits of such an Office, but only has it in him to Grant. As in 6 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. but if the <hi>King</hi> had a Title to the thing it self, it were otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Writ in this case comes too late after a <hi>Special Verdict,</hi> and the matter fully and oftentimes discuss't in <hi>Court,</hi> and the <hi>Court</hi> fully informed of all the matter alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: So that if the Writ should be alleowd in this case, there would be a manifest delay, contrary to the Statute of <hi>Magna Carta, nulli negabimus, nulli differemus Justiciam, &amp;c.</hi> the case in <hi>Dyer,</hi> 100. <hi>b. Colepeper versus . . . . . . .</hi> does not come up to this; for there it was <hi>pendente placito indiscusso;</hi> but here the matter has bèen discuss't, a <hi>Special Verdict</hi> found and the matter debated upon solemn Argument: Nor does there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the <hi>Court</hi> any new matter in the <hi>Writ;</hi> no more than what has béen disclosed in the procéedings before them. And
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:52142:188"/> in 9 <hi>Rep. in Ann Bedingfield's Case;</hi> the Writ of <hi>Rege Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulto</hi> was brought before Plea pleaded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Court</hi> here is as fully informed by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before them as by the <hi>Writ,</hi> of the <hi>King's</hi> Title; so that the <hi>King</hi> needs be no more consulted: And the party is at a prejudice by this delay; for if the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> or <hi>Defendant</hi> dye, or the term expire, there is an end of the Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the <hi>Court</hi> procéed when they ought to surcease, it is <hi>Error,</hi> and a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> lies upon it: So that the <hi>King</hi> is at no prejudice.</p>
               <p>Vpon these Grounds and Reasons I prayed, that the <hi>Court</hi> would disallow the Writ, and procéed to <hi>Judgment</hi> without putting the Parties to more Charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Stevens, Mr. Attorny and Mr. Sollicitor General, spake to it on the other side.</hi>

                  <hi>In Trin. Term.</hi> 19 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Sir Robert Atkyns</hi> Argued <hi>pro Quer.</hi> Admitting that the <hi>Writ</hi> would lie at any time before <hi>Judgment,</hi> and that it will lie in <hi>Ejectment:</hi> As <hi>Moor's Rep. Brownlows Case,</hi> and the Cases there cited, are: And that it is not against <hi>Magna Carta; Nulli differemus, &amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a Writ at <hi>Common Law. vide</hi> 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 490. <hi>N. B.</hi> 153. Yet he said, the <hi>Writ</hi> consisted of <hi>two</hi> Parts. <hi>First,</hi> A Certificate of the <hi>King's</hi> Title. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Mandatory: Which is as it were a Conclusion drawn from the Premisses, and must not go beyond them: for the Title being certified, the <hi>Court</hi> is to Iudge upon that and upon nothing else; as in 9 <hi>Rep. Ann Bedingfield's Case,</hi> and it does not appear to the <hi>Court,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> is concerned in this Suit. There are thrée Records in this case; <hi>First,</hi> The Suit here by <hi>Ejectment. Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Inquisition. Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Writ.</hi> As for the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> that is void, because <hi>Seventeen Commissioners</hi> were appointed, and the Inquisition taken but by <hi>five</hi> of them: <hi>Pl. Com.</hi> 390. 393, 396; the case there was stronger than ours, and yet all was void: And if the <hi>Inquisition</hi> be void, all that depends upon it, is so too, as the Plea, the Iudgment, &amp;c. <hi>quia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile fundamentum fallit opus:</hi> And Authorities must be strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued; <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 181. <hi>b. Dyer,</hi> 93. <hi>b.</hi> 375. <hi>b.</hi> 247. Also the Iudgment upon the Inquisition does not conclude <hi>Dennys,</hi> who is no party to it, though he claim under one that is party to it; for he has no remedy by Writ for <hi>Error</hi> or otherwise. <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 70, 193. 8 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 14. Also this Iudgment upon the Inquisition is contrary to the Act of <hi>General Pardon,</hi> which pardons this Forfeiture, and is therefore void; likewise the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had commenced his Suit before the Inquisition, <hi>vide</hi> 22 <hi>Ass.</hi> 5. <hi>Br.

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:52142:188"/> the <hi>Defendant</hi> only, by reason of this <hi>Patent;</hi> and both parties claim under the <hi>King.</hi> So that in that respect the <hi>King</hi> is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned for both. <hi>Vide</hi> 4 <hi>Inst.</hi> 118. And the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> here is a <hi>Debtor</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> so that upon that account the <hi>King</hi> is more concerned on his behalf. <hi>Vide</hi> 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 86. 15 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 16. Nor is there any such Title here as the Writ recites; for the Writ recites a Lease for 4 years, whereas the Lease was for 7 years, as appears by the Record; and so concluded <hi>pro Quer.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Winnington pro Defendente.</hi> He agréed, that if the Writ had set forth no Title, it would have béen within <hi>Magna Charta. c.</hi> 29. which was made against <hi>General Writs of Prerogative;</hi> wherewith agrees 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8. But a Writ that discloses a <hi>Special Tile</hi> is against no Law, as this Writ does; it is an <hi>Aid pryer &amp; aliquid amplius.</hi> 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 44. <hi>N. B.</hi> 153. But because his Argument only aimed at the answering of some <hi>Objections,</hi> that had béen made before, I will not relate it. And especially because it was said by the <hi>Lord Chief Baron Hales,</hi> and agreed to by the <hi>Court,</hi> that this <hi>Writ</hi> could not be allowed, because it was grounded upon a <hi>void Inquisition;</hi> And upon a Suit of which there is no Record here; the Lease upon Record here being a Lease for 7 years, and the Record recited being of a Suit upon a Lease for 4 years: So that this <hi>Writ</hi> cannot be maintained.</p>
               <p>Whereupon another Writ, in which these faults were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, was sent, and allowed. And he said that this Writ is only in Lieu of an <hi>Aid prayer;</hi> and because it is a delay to the party, he ought to be heard before it issue out of <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</hi> But he conceived, that though the <hi>King</hi> be equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; both parties claiming under him, that yet that is no cause to stay the <hi>Writ;</hi> as in 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. because it is for the <hi>King's</hi> benefit, to have his Grants served as soon as may be; for then the <hi>King</hi> may pleasure another; and he said, that the <hi>General pardon</hi> makes nothing in the case, for it is not pleaded nor comes into the case. And upon the <hi>new Writ,</hi> the matter was <hi>Adjourned.</hi>

And whether these <hi>Copyhold</hi> Lands were <hi>Forfeited</hi> by the Act of <hi>Attainder,</hi> or not, was the <hi>Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Act there are <hi>three Clauses</hi> to be considered; <hi>First,</hi> The Clause that gives the Forfeiture to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>all Mannors, Messuages, Lands, Tenements, Rents, Reversions, Remainders, Possessions, Rights, Conditions, Interests, Offices, Fees, Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and all other Hereditaments, which the person Attainted had the five and twentieth day of March, 1646. or at any time since. And that they shall be in the Actual possession of the</hi> King, <hi>without Office or Inquisition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is a <hi>Proviso</hi> added in favour of <hi>Purchasers;</hi> which provides, that <hi>no Grant or Conveyance, Grants or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renders by Copy, &amp;c. (not being the</hi> King's, Queen's, Bishops <hi>or pretended</hi> Delinqeunts <hi>Lands) had or made before the 29 day of Semptember 1659, by any the persons Attainted, (other than to their Wives, Children, Heir or Heirs,) for Mony</hi> bona fide <hi>paid or lent, &amp;c. shall be Impeached, Defeated, made void or Frustrated, but the same shall be enjoyed by the Purchasors, Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, &amp;c. as if this Act had not been made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Clause is a <hi>saving;</hi> which saves to <hi>all Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and other persons, all such Right and Title, and Interest in Law and Equity, which they or any of them had or ought to have of, in, to or out of the Premisses, (not in trust for the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, nor derived by, from or under the Offenders, since the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:52142:189"/> 25th of <hi>March</hi> 1646) and that in every such case the entries of all such persons are saved, notwithstanding the possession of the King or his Patentee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Case there are <hi>Three</hi> things considerable.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Whether or no, by the General words in the <hi>first Clause Copyhold Lands</hi> are <hi>forfeited</hi> to the <hi>King?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Proviso</hi> adds any strength or force to those General words?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How the <hi>Saving</hi> shall operate?</p>
               <p>And I conceive that these <hi>General Words</hi> of <hi>all Lands, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Hereditaments,</hi> do not <hi>forfeit Copyhold Lands</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> and that the <hi>Proviso</hi> does not enlarge them.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>General words</hi> of <hi>All Lands, Tenements, and Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments,</hi> they do not comprize <hi>Copyhold</hi> Estates; by an express Iudgment given in <hi>Co. 3. Rep. Heydon's Case:</hi> Where it is laid down for a Rule, That <hi>General Words</hi> in an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> do not extend to <hi>Copyholds Lands,</hi> where the <hi>Tenure, Service, Interest</hi> in the Land, or other thing in prejudice of the <hi>Lord,</hi> or of the Custom of the <hi>Mannor</hi> is thereby altered: And <hi>Cro. Car. pag. 42. Rowden versus Malster,</hi> the same Observation is made by Thrée Iudges; and upon that reason it is there Resolved, That <hi>Copyholds</hi> are not within the <hi>Statute de Donis Conditionalibus;</hi> because then the <hi>Donee</hi> would hold of the <hi>Donor,</hi> and so the Tenure be altered, and the <hi>Lord</hi> preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced in the Wardship of the Lands, and change of <hi>Tenants</hi> would not so often happen; and upon the same Reason it is Resolved, that <hi>Westm. 2. cap. 20. of Elegit: 27. Hen. 8. cap. 10. of Uses: 31 Hen. 8. &amp; 32 Hen. 8. of Partition</hi> to be made by a Writ <hi>de Partitione faciendâ: 32 Hen. 8. cap. 28. of Leases for 21 years, &amp;c.</hi> by <hi>Tenant in tail, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>32 Hen. 8. cap. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> of Entry for Conditions enfreint by Grantees of Reversions,</hi> do not extend to <hi>Copyhold Estates,</hi> which are stronger Cases than this of ours; for there the prejudice to the <hi>Lord</hi> is but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pary; here it is for ever. Vpon the same Reason it has béen adjudged <hi>in Mich. 30 Eliz. in Sulyard and Everard's Case,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> cannot seize <hi>two</hi> parts of the <hi>Copyhold Lands</hi> of a <hi>Recusant convict;</hi> though the <hi>King</hi> has but a Title in that case to the <hi>Pernancy</hi> of the Profits during the <hi>Recusancy:</hi> And it was there agréed by the Court, that <hi>Copyholds</hi> would not have béen comprized within the Statutes of <hi>Bankrupts</hi> without <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Words.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:52142:190"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mich. 33 &amp; 34 Eliz. in B.C.</hi> held by <hi>Anderson</hi> and <hi>Walmsley,</hi> that if a <hi>Baron</hi> be attainted of Treason, the <hi>Feme</hi> does not by the <hi>Stat. of 5 Ed. 6.</hi> forfeit her <hi>Dower</hi> of <hi>Copyhold Lands,</hi> of which she is <hi>dowable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Co. 4 Rep. 126.</hi> in <hi>Beverley's Case</hi> adjudged, that the <hi>King</hi> shall not have the Custody of the <hi>Copyhold Lands</hi> of an <hi>Ideot</hi> for the Reason aforesaid; though the <hi>Stat. de Praerogativa Regis</hi> give him the Custody of <hi>all the Lands and Tenements</hi> of the <hi>Ideot;</hi> and though the words are, that the <hi>King</hi> shall have the Custody of the Lands, of whomsoever they are holden.</p>
               <p>And because there is the same Reason in our Case, the Law ought to be the same. For if the Lands should come to the <hi>King</hi>'s hands by this <hi>Attainder,</hi> the <hi>Copyhold Estate</hi> would be destroyed, and the <hi>Lord</hi> be prejudiced in his <hi>Tenure, Fines,</hi> and <hi>Services</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p>But on the other hand, where no such prejudice accrues to the <hi>Lord,</hi> but where he is in the same condition as before, there such general words in an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> will extend to <hi>Copyholds;</hi> as the <hi>Stat. of Merton cap. 1. Westm. 2. cap. 3. 32 Hen. 8. cap. 9. &amp; 28.</hi> as appears <hi>Co. 4 Rep. 26, 30. Cro. Car.</hi> before cited, <hi>pag. 42.</hi> and <hi>9 Rep. Mary Prodgers Case 105.</hi> upon the <hi>Stat. of 4 Hen. 7. of Fines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that all the Cases cited on the other side, may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered upon this distinction, <hi>viz.</hi> where a <hi>Prejudice</hi> may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and where not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing to be considered, is, Whether the <hi>Proviso</hi> in the Act of <hi>Attainder,</hi> brings <hi>Copyhold Lands</hi> not excepted within the Body of the Act? And I conceive it does not for these Reasons:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because the words <hi>Grants and Surrenders, &amp;c.</hi> may have another Intendment; as in case of <hi>Grants</hi> made by Copy of Court-Roll by <hi>Lords Attainted,</hi> after the Forfeiture committed, or upon <hi>Escheats</hi> to them: For all such passing of Copyhold Estates by <hi>Surrender, &amp;c.</hi> are but so may <hi>Grants</hi> made by the <hi>Lord,</hi> and are so pleaded; as appears <hi>Co. 4 Rep. Copy hold Cases, &amp;c.</hi> This is enough to satisfie those words; and besides, the <hi>Proviso</hi> was added in favour of Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Words are oftentimes inserted into a <hi>Proviso,</hi> though not comprized in the Body of the Act, and rather to satisfie Lay-men and some Members of Parliament not learned in the Law, than for any necessity there is of them; as appears by many Cases. <hi>Co. 1 Rep. Porter's Case;</hi> so the <hi>5 Ed. c. 16.</hi> concerning <hi>Offices:</hi> The Body of the Act extends only to Offices, in which the administration of Iustice is
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:52142:190"/> concerned; and yet there comes an Exception of the Office of <hi>Parkership.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>18 &amp; 19 Eliz. Dyer 354.</hi> it is there held, That whereas the <hi>Statute of Wills</hi> made <hi>32 Hen. 8.</hi> has a <hi>Proviso</hi> for <hi>Feme-Coverts</hi> and <hi>Infants,</hi> that those words are idle and superfluous; because the Body of the Act, by the words <hi>All persons,</hi> doth not extend to include persons that by Law are disabled.</p>
               <p>So here the words <hi>Grants and Surrenders</hi> by <hi>Copy of Court-Roll,</hi> were put and crowded into the <hi>Proviso,</hi> rather to satisfie some persons that were Purchasers, than out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the words of the <hi>Proviso,</hi> which was made for the benefit of the Subject, should be admitted to be an Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Body of the Act; then would the <hi>Saving</hi> be invalidated, whereby <hi>the Rights of all Persons are saved, which they had or ought to have in, to or out of the Premisses.</hi> This <hi>Saving</hi> cannot be maintain'd, if the <hi>Lord</hi> must lose his <hi>Seigniory,</hi> and his Right to <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Admittances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Act</hi> did not aim at the loss of any, but of the <hi>Offender</hi> himself; else it would have punished the <hi>Nocent</hi> with the <hi>Innocent,</hi> and that in as high a degree. For the benefit that <hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Mannors</hi> have by the <hi>Copyhold Estates</hi> held of them, by reason of <hi>Fines, Forfeitures,</hi> and other <hi>Perquisites,</hi> is <hi>tantamount</hi> to the Interest that the <hi>Copyholder</hi> himself has in the Tenancy, or in a manner as good and beneficial; and for that reason by doubtful, general and ambiguous words, <hi>Copyholds</hi> shall not be taken to be within the <hi>Act.</hi> Vpon these Reasons and Authorities I pray'd Iudgment <hi>pro Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Edward Thurland</hi> argued <hi>pro Querente;</hi> but I did not take his <hi>Argument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chief Baron:</hi> If this Estate be forfeited, the <hi>Copyhold</hi> will be destroyed, and it will pass by <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> and not by <hi>Surrender;</hi> and it would be a hard Construction to expound an Act of Parliament, so as to destroy the Interest of an Innocent person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crispe and Pratt's Case, Cro. Car. Anno 15.</hi> has béen objected; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Copyhold Lands</hi> are within the Statutes of <hi>1 Jac. &amp; 21 Jac.</hi> concerning <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> by reason of the words, <hi>Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments,</hi> and may be sold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Those words do not make the Reason; but the Reason is, because <hi>Copyhold Estates</hi> are expresly mentioned in the <hi>Statute of 13 Eliz.</hi> concerning <hi>Bankrupts;</hi> and therefore the Acts of <hi>King James</hi> being but subsequent and additional Acts, and by way of Explanation, Confirmation, and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:52142:191"/> of that <hi>Act of Eliz.</hi> and being beneficial Laws, for that Reason <hi>Copyholds</hi> have béen held within the later <hi>Laws,</hi> because they were expresly named in the former; but if <hi>Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds</hi> had not been named in the <hi>Statute of 13 Eliz.</hi> the general words afore-mentioned would not have brought them within the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>King James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ. 2.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> in that case is at no prejudice; for the Assignee of the Commissioners is to be admitted and to pay the <hi>Lord</hi> his <hi>Fine;</hi> which cannot be done here in the <hi>King</hi>'s case; so that Case comes not up to ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Who shall have the <hi>Copyhold</hi> then? For the <hi>Lord</hi> is not mentioned in the Statute to have it, but the <hi>King;</hi> and by what means shall any other come by it, and how?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> shall have it as an <hi>Escheat, pro defectu Haeredis;</hi> the person <hi>Attainted</hi> being dead, and his Blood cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the <hi>Attainder,</hi> as in case of <hi>Felony</hi> or <hi>Treason</hi> at Common Law; the <hi>Lord</hi> shall have the Land in possession in lieu of his Fines and Services, and all other benefits and advantages of his Seignory.</p>
               <p>There was a Case betwixt <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> which came into the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>King's-Bench</hi> out of <hi>Chancery 23 Jun. 16 Car. Regis:</hi> The Case was, <hi>Holland</hi> had purchased a <hi>Copyhold</hi> in Fée in <hi>trust</hi> for an <hi>Alien;</hi> and upon Office found the <hi>King</hi> seised, to have Profits answered to him: And <hi>per Cur'</hi> it was not seisible, nor was the Trust forfeited to the <hi>King;</hi> and an <hi>Amoveas manum</hi> was granted <hi>Trin. 23 Car. in B. R.</hi> And the Reasons were,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because then the <hi>Lord</hi> would be at a prejudice in losing his Services and Fines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Prejudice may arise to a <hi>Stranger</hi> hereby, who may claim a Title to this <hi>Copyhold;</hi> and if it were not in the <hi>King</hi>'s hands, might sue for it in the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Court; but the <hi>King</hi> cannot be sued there. <hi>Vide 4 Rep. 30. 14 Hen. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, De minimis non curat lex.</hi> And it does not consist with the Honour of the <hi>King</hi> to become a <hi>Copyholder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Custom of the <hi>Mannor,</hi> and the Tenancy at Will, are the foundations of a <hi>Copyhold Estate;</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> cannot be Tenant to any, much less Tenant at Will: For if this Estate should come to him, he comes in by Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> By this means the <hi>King</hi> will be in a worse condition, than a <hi>Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:52142:191"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> In cases that touch his Regality, and concern him in point of Honour, the matter is not great if he abate of his Profit to save his Dignity, and prevent what might be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to him. This does not put him into a worse condition than a Subject, though it may séem so to do; but it is more for his Honour. And for this cause the <hi>King</hi> shall not be received in a Real Action to defend his Right, as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon person shall; because the <hi>King</hi> cannot be a <hi>Tenant, 25 Ed. 3. 47.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Death of the Tenant, his Blood being corrupted by the <hi>Attainder,</hi> there is no great doubt, but that <hi>pro defectu Haeredis,</hi> the Land shall escheat to the <hi>Lord.</hi> But if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son attainted were alive, some question might be made, who should enjoy the Profits during his life?</p>

And in an <hi>Iter,</hi> 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. a Iudgment was cited in point in a like case, in this very Forest of a <hi>Common by Prescription.</hi> But the <hi>Chief Baron</hi> doubted upon these Grounds; <hi>viz.</hi> he said there were three manner of Forests: <hi>First, Ancient Forests de temps dont, &amp;c.</hi> before <hi>Charta de Foresta,</hi> called <hi>Charta Parva,</hi> with respect to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which passed in the same year. <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are <hi>New Forests</hi> made in the Reigns of <hi>King Henry the Second, Richard the First, King John, &amp;c.</hi> A <hi>third</hi> sort of <hi>Forests</hi> are such as were partly ancient and partly new: In regard the ancient Bounds of the <hi>Forests</hi> were enlarged, and Grounds taken in to the <hi>Forest</hi> that had not anciently belonged to it. And that is the Reason of the Saving in 9 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>in Charta de Foresta;</hi> saving all Commons accustomed, though the Lands of the Owners were Disafforested by the Act; because
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:52142:192"/> they had béen Afforested in the Reign of <hi>King Hen.</hi> 2. or <hi>King John, &amp;c.</hi> to the prejudice of the Owners of the Land, who had Common there; and were not Rightfully within the <hi>Forest,</hi> and therefore it was but reason that upon the Deafforestation of those Lands, the Owners should enjoy their Customs; and this is the true ground of that Saving in the Act. But afterwards in 12 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. there were other <hi>Peram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations;</hi> whereby many <hi>Forests</hi> were enlarged, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Subject: And thereupon afterwards, in 28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. there was another <hi>Perambulation</hi> made, by which the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himself much prejudiced in abridging the Bounds of the Forest, and exempting Lands out of the <hi>Forest,</hi> which in truth were part of it. Vpon these Grievances on both sides, both to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi> occasioned by these Perambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made after 9 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>his Subjects</hi> concerned therein, came to an accord and agréement; and thereupon <hi>Ann.</hi> 33 <hi>&amp;</hi> 34 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>Ordinatio Forestae</hi> was made; whereby it is declared by assent of both parties, that the Deafforestations made upon those Perambulations (be they right or wrong) should be quite discharged of the Forest: But then the Owners of the Ground were not to have Common there. But such who were content to continue their Lands within the <hi>Forest,</hi> were to have <hi>Common,</hi> as they had used formerly to have it.</p>
               <p>And this is the true state of the Case upon these Statutes. Which being admitted, it may be possible that the <hi>Defendants</hi> here ought to have <hi>Common,</hi> notwithstanding this <hi>Deaffore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station</hi> of their Lands. For if their Lands were not duly and of right afforested, and that they had <hi>Common by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> in the <hi>Forest;</hi> it was not the intent of the <hi>Ordinatio Forestae</hi> to toll such a Common. But if they were well afforested at first, and afterwards disafforested unduly by some Perambulation, then the Common is lost, if the Owner will have the Land remain Disafforested: And this is the true Meaning, and Interpretation, and Intent of this Act of <hi>Ordinatio Forestae;</hi> and this being Matter of Fact, and it not appearing of what nature these Lands are that are now Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afforested, nor whether there be a <hi>Common by Prescription</hi> in the case; this Cause is not yet ripe for a <hi>Decree,</hi> which must be made one way or other, as the Matter of Fact shall guide us. And this is the first ground of my Doubt.</p>
               <pb n="439" facs="tcp:52142:192"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Act of <hi>Ordinatio Forestae</hi> makes but a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary suspension of the Common Law, <hi>viz.</hi> so long as the Owners of the Lands would be out of the Forest, <hi>&amp; non ultrà:</hi> So that there cannot be in such a case an <hi>Absolute Decree,</hi> or a <hi>perpetual Injunction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My <hi>Third Reason</hi> is, because now by the <hi>Statute of</hi> 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.16. the Lands cannot be afforested again; and therefore it would be hard to take away Common, where it is due of right.</p>
               <p>For these Reasons he would not deliver any positive Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the case, which he said was a Case of great importance, and deserved another kind of Argument than upon an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Demurrer in Law: Which yet the <hi>Court</hi> never refuseth to hear upon the least difficulty (though the consequence be many times of small concernment,) that this Cause deserved more consideration, than to be determined by a sudden Opinion upon the Hearing. But because the <hi>Chancellor of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> and the other <hi>Barons</hi> were against him, the <hi>Decree</hi> passed <hi>pro Rege.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(1)"/> AN <hi>Information</hi> was exhibited in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> against the <hi>Defendant</hi> as <hi>Heir</hi> and <hi>Terre-tenant</hi> of the Lands of <hi>Sir Roger Palmer,</hi> late <hi>Knight of the Bath</hi> and <hi>Cofferer</hi> of the Houshold to the late <hi>King Charles the First,</hi> for 63139 <hi>l.</hi> 18 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d. ob.</hi> received by him as <hi>Cofferer,</hi> from the 1st <hi>of October</hi> 1641, to the 2d <hi>of October</hi> 1642; and to have a discovery, &amp;c.

To which the <hi>Attorney General</hi> replied, and set forth the Exception of all <hi>Issues, Fines, Amercements, Rents, and other publick Duties, levied, received and collected by any Sheriff, Undersheriff, Bayliff, Minister, or other Officer, to or for the Use of the late King, &amp;c. and not accounted for and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged;</hi> and that 44853 <hi>l.</hi> 1 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d. ob.</hi> part of the said Sum is unaccounted for by the said <hi>Sir Roger Palmer,</hi> and by him received as <hi>Cofferer</hi> aforesaid, in pursuance of <hi>two Acts</hi> made in <hi>quinto Eliz and primo Jac.</hi> concerning payment to be made, and to be apply'd for the payment of the Expences of the Houshold to the yearly value of 50000 <hi>l.</hi> and that Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments should be made by the <hi>Lord Treasurer</hi> for that purpose: And sets forth also, the Exception of <hi>all Offences in detaining, imbezelling, or purloyning any Goods, Moneys, Chattels, or Jewels of the late King, Queen or Prince, other than Stores for Shipping, and other than such Goods and Chattels, as have been sold or disposed to any Creditors of His Majesty,</hi> and avers those Moneys so received were the Moneys of the late <hi>King,</hi> and not paid or laid out for his use, and so excepted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Question</hi> was, Whether the Mony so received by the <hi>Cofferer</hi> were <hi>excepted,</hi> or not, by any Clause in the Act. And I conceived it was not excepted, and therefore discharged by the <hi>Act of Pardon;</hi> for these Reasons:</p>
               <pb n="441" facs="tcp:52142:193"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Act of <hi>Oblivion</hi> is an Act of General and free <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Indemnity,</hi> and is to be taken according as the words are, and as the Act expresseth it self, but beneficially for the advantage and benefit of all subjects in General, and all <hi>Exceptions</hi> out of it are to be taken <hi>strictly. Hill.</hi> 11. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Bell's Case, Cro. Car.</hi> 324. there was an exception out of an Act of General Pardon of the <hi>taking</hi> and <hi>imbezilling</hi> of the Kings goods, yet the <hi>Felony</hi> in imbezilling them was not excepted. <hi>Cro. Car. Priest's Case</hi> 258. there was an exception out of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pardon of <hi>Quare Impedits</hi> where there was no Incumbent; this did not extend where there was an Incumbent <hi>de facto</hi> by a Plurality, tho' the Statute of Pluralities makes the <hi>first</hi> Benefice <hi>ipso facto</hi> void in that case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pasch.</hi> 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. In this <hi>Court</hi> in a <hi>Scire facias versus Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Pococke</hi> for 2272 <hi>l.</hi> by them received in the late times of War, of others than Collectors and Treasurers for sick and maimed Soldiers: The <hi>Court</hi> in that case held this sum not excepted by the <hi>General exception</hi> of monies received by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers, Collectors, &amp;c, in the late times of War, &amp;c. because it was mony received of them, and not by them; and therefore it was not within the Intention of the Act. So I say here, the sums received by the <hi>Cofferer</hi> at <hi>second hand</hi> of other Receivers and Collectors by Assignment, are not within the Intention or meaning of any exception in this Act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is not within the scope of any exception of <hi>Accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants:</hi> For those exceptions aim at <hi>two sorts</hi> of <hi>Accountants. First,</hi> Treasurers, Receivers and Collectors of things in time of War before the 30 of <hi>January</hi> 1642, which does not concern out case. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To <hi>Accountants,</hi> as ordinary Ministers of Iustice, and ordinary Receivers <hi>in pais.</hi> And it begins with <hi>Sheriffs, Undersheriffs, Bayliffs, Ministers or other Officers,</hi> which cannot reasonably be supposed to extend to such <hi>Superior</hi> Officers or Accountants. If they had béen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have béen excepted, without doubt they would have béen excepted by express words.</p>
               <p>Besides, these <hi>Accountants</hi> become so by receipts by Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Lord Treasurer</hi> for a provision for the <hi>King's</hi> Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and it shall not be presumed that such receipts, disbursed and employed for the maintaining the <hi>King's</hi> own Houshold, and which must consequently follow the <hi>King</hi> himself, should be excepted; but such receipts only as do not follow the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="442" facs="tcp:52142:194"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Account is not within the exception of the words <hi>Ministers or other Officers,</hi> for this Officer, being <hi>Cofferer</hi> of the Houshold, is in a superior degrée of Officers, and so their Accounts are distinguish't in this <hi>Court,</hi> from those of <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and <hi>other Officers.</hi> So that <hi>superior</hi> Officers shall not be comprehended within any General words, after <hi>inferior</hi> Officers expressed by name; because it shall be intended, that if they had béen designed to have béen included, they would have béen named at first. <hi>Vide</hi> 2 <hi>Rep.</hi> 46. <hi>b.</hi> the <hi>Archbishop of Canterburies Case,</hi> 22 <hi>Ass.</hi> 49. The <hi>King</hi> Grants <hi>bona felonum &amp; qualitercunque damnatorum,</hi> this does not extend to <hi>High-Treason,</hi> because <hi>Felony</hi> is named at first. 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 54. <hi>b.</hi> The <hi>Statute of</hi> 8 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. limits the process upon Inditements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Iustices of the Peace, or other Commissioners in case of Outlawry: These last words do not extend to the Iustices of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>King's Bench,</hi> which are superior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Cofferer</hi> shall not be taken to be within the General scope, or intention of any exception in the Act, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the whole drift of the Act, is for the benefit of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and like Acts have always been expounded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 18. <hi>b. Cecill's Case,</hi> Remedy is given by 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 39. to recover debts due to the <hi>King</hi> upon <hi>Obligation,</hi> this does not extend to <hi>Obligations for performance of Covenants. Scaccario Mich.</hi> 16. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Attorny General and Holt.</hi> The new Act of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> which gives remedy against the <hi>Farmers</hi> of Excise and their Sureties, upon their Recognisances, does not extend to Commissioners, because they are not named.</p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Trin.</hi> 21 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. the <hi>Court</hi> delivered their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, that this Account was pardoned, and did not come within any exceptions of the Act: Not within the <hi>first</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for that is intended only of such Goods and Mony, as was once actually in the <hi>King's</hi> possession and keeping, and wrongfully taken from him, as was done in the late Wars; and not of Goods or Mony belonging to the <hi>King,</hi> which were in the Hands of any other person: For if such an exposition were made, it would open a gap to let out all things that are pardoned by the Act, with relation to Goods and Mony. For in a large sense mony in the hands of the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, or 20th Receiver, which appertains to the <hi>King,</hi> may be said to be the <hi>King's</hi> Mony. Nor is it within the other Exception, for the <hi>Cofferer</hi> is a person of higher Rank, than any that are there named; and a superior shall not be included, where an inferior is first named; as appears 2 <hi>Rep. in the Archbishop of Canterburies Case,</hi> and so the Plea allowed <hi>per Curiam.</hi>

               <p>The Iury found moreover, that the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> was an ancient City, before the 12 <hi>of Octob.</hi> 19 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and that the <hi>Defendant</hi> was a <hi>Citizen,</hi> and had served an Apprenticeship to a Vintner in <hi>London,</hi> before the Information brought: And that he kept a Tavern in <hi>London,</hi> and had sold 8 <hi>Pints of Sack</hi> there, without a License according to 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ellis pro Quer.</hi> made two Questions. <hi>First,</hi> Whether these Letters Patents are good, and a sufficient dispensation to the <hi>Citizens of London,</hi> and their <hi>Successors</hi> in perpetuity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Statute of</hi> 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. does not take it away, or whether it be saved to them by the <hi>Proviso</hi> in that Statute?</p>
               <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> The Letters Patents are not good, nor is such a Dispensation legal: It is granted to the whole body of the City, and extends to dispense with all Acts of Parliament, made and to be made, and it Grants the Citizens liberty to sell Wines in what places they list, and to set up Taverns. And admitting that such a Grant were good and valid in Law, notwithstanding any penal Act of Parliament to the Contrary, yet can it not bind a <hi>Succeeding King:</hi> For the Original of these <hi>Dispensations</hi> with Acts of Parliament, he referred to <hi>Sir John Davie's Reports,</hi> and the Abuses there mentioned.</p>
               <p>His <hi>First</hi> Reason, why the said Dispensation is now of no force, was because it was a méer <hi>License,</hi> and an <hi>Authority,</hi> it vested no Interest, and consequently died with the King. By the same Reason, 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 82. Commissions died with the King. 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 3. 4. Protection <hi>pro Rege &amp; Successoribus suis,</hi> naught. <hi>Latch's Rep.</hi> 58. If the King's Grant passeth an Interest, the Successors are bound thereby, otherwise not. 1 <hi>Mar. Dyer</hi> 92. <hi>Dav. Rep.</hi> 90. A Grant to a
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:52142:195"/>
                  <hi>Merchant Alien</hi> to pay <hi>English Customs,</hi> shall bind the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, if named, because the Customs are an Inheritance in the Crown. So 36 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 48. <hi>Dyer</hi> 52. a Grant for the King and his Successors to the King's Tenant, that the Heir of the Grantée shall not be in Ward, is binding to the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, because the Seignory is an Interest in the King. A Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to Alien must be executed, in the life of the King that Grants it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But a License to Alien in <hi>Mortmain</hi> may be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted after his Death, <hi>F. N. Br.</hi> 223. <hi>Pl. Com.</hi> 457.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> 1 <hi>Inst.</hi> 99. 457. Because no <hi>Non-obstante</hi> is requisite, and it is an <hi>Interest</hi> in the King, but the <hi>mesne Lords</hi> are not bound thereby; with which agrées 43 <hi>Ass.</hi> 19. But where a bare Authority passeth and no more, it is otherwise. As in the case of a <hi>Commission of Sewers,</hi> and therefore it is enacted by Parliament, that those Commissions shall continue for ten years; <hi>viz.</hi> by 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. in <hi>Latch, Thoresby's Case,</hi> 2 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. 70, 71. The death of the King dissolves the Parliament.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Second</hi> Reason was taken from the <hi>Nature</hi> of these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, <hi>viz.</hi> from their <hi>Largness</hi> and <hi>Extent:</hi> Being V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal and perpetual, and enabling them to set up as many Taverns as they pleased, and to sell Wines where they would, and at what prices they would. That such <hi>General</hi> Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were void in Law, he quoted 11 <hi>Rep. the Case of Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies.</hi> And 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 36. 37. <hi>the Case of Penal Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He urged that the Grant <hi>not stinting</hi> them to <hi>any number</hi> of Taverns might give occasion of Excess and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; And <hi>Supernumerary Taverns,</hi> he said, were <hi>Nusances</hi> in Law, which could not be dispensed with. <hi>Vide</hi> 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 12. So the excess of Building in and near the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> has béen punished in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> as a <hi>Nusance,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the <hi>King's License.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This Grant is <hi>primae Impressionis,</hi> and therefore void, as appears by the cases just now cited out of the 11 <hi>and</hi> 7 <hi>Rep.</hi>

Such things as are inseparably annex't to
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:52142:195"/> the Crown may be dispensed with, notwithstanding any Act of Parliament prohibiting such Dispensations: <hi>Vide</hi> 12 <hi>Rep.</hi> 18. But in other things which are common to the King with his Subjects, the King may be restrained: As by the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> concerning Leases; <hi>Vide Co. Rep. Magdalen Colledge Case.</hi> So in the case of <hi>Simony,</hi> No <hi>Non-obstante</hi> can make a <hi>Simoniacus</hi> capable of the living, that he was once presented to by <hi>Simony: Vide</hi> 1 <hi>Inst.</hi> 120. Vpon the Statute of 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. of <hi>Officers,</hi> In our case the King had <hi>no Inheritance,</hi> and therefore such a <hi>Dispensation</hi> as this, is void.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The King cannot transfer his power of dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the City, because it is inseparably annex't to the Crown. 20 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 8. 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 25.

And this is such a Grant; for every Fréeman is to be licensed by the City, and the Widow of a Fréeman is to enjoy the Priviledge. And they may admit whom they will to be Frée.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It is a great Trust committed to the City, which is an ancient and a famous Corporation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> But is communicable by them to as many as they please.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It is but an Authority and a Priviledge, which is a Flower of the Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The case in 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 35. is a stronger case than ours, and yet there the Grant was adjugded void.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Second</hi> Point, he held that the Act of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. had taken away this Priviledge, and repealed the Act of 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. and that the Priviledge was not saved by the <hi>Proviso,</hi> in the Act of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. and that the <hi>Non obstante</hi> in the Patent could not have any influence upon a subsequent Law. <hi>Dyer</hi> 52.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First Reason.</hi> Because the Grant here is not to the <hi>Master, &amp;c. of the Company of Vintners,</hi> if it were, the Act had excepted it, but to the City of <hi>London,</hi> and there is no Grant to the <hi>Vintners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second Reason.</hi> Vsage mentioned in the <hi>Proviso,</hi> is to be understood of <hi>lawful</hi> Vsage; and is so expressed; <hi>viz. As heretofore they have lawfully used and enjoyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Then the mentioning of the <hi>Master Wardens, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Commonalty of the Vintners of London,</hi> in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso,</hi> will be void; and insignificant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The <hi>saving</hi> must of necessity be void as to them, if there were no Grant made to them: As in <hi>Pl. Com.</hi> 507. <hi>Dyer</hi> 150.</p>
               <pb n="446" facs="tcp:52142:196"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third Reason.</hi> No Priviledge was intended to be saved by this Act, but such as may be raised and created by a Common and Vsual <hi>Non-obstante;</hi> the <hi>Proviso</hi> must not be presumed to Extend to any other. A <hi>Non-obstante</hi> to the <hi>Statute of</hi> 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. may be supposed to be saved by the <hi>Proviso</hi> in 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. But the <hi>Non-obstante</hi> in our case, is in opposition to a future Law. Besides, a <hi>Non-obstante</hi> does not make void a Law; but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseth with a Law <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc.</hi> But if this <hi>Non-obstante</hi> be allowed, it will be perpetual. Wherefore he held it void; and not saved by the <hi>Proviso,</hi> and concluded <hi>pro Querente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Robert Atkyns pro Defendente.</hi> He made two Points; <hi>First,</hi> Concerning the <hi>Prerogative of Despensations. Secondly,</hi> Concerning the <hi>Nature of this Dispensation</hi> in particular.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>First</hi> he said, the Original and the Necessity of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations,</hi> is the fundamental Law of the Land. For all Men and Acts of Parliament are fallible: And therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that a power of dispensing with them upon occasion, should be lodged in the <hi>King.</hi> All Emergencies cannot be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séen, and therefore our Law in Iustice and prudence gives this power to the <hi>King.</hi> And if it were not so, great mischiefs might accrue to the People: New Laws are for the most part only <hi>Probationers,</hi> and in intervals of Parliaments, great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice may arise by them; and therefore it is but just that the <hi>King,</hi> who is the Fountain of Iustice and Mercy, should have a power to dispence in such cases, for the avoiding mischief and danger to the Realm. <hi>Vide Sir Francis Bacon's Advancement of Learning;</hi> and <hi>Dr. and Stud.</hi> 85. And God himself indulged Dispensations to the <hi>Jews,</hi> with the positive Laws of <hi>Moses,</hi> as when he gave them leave to rob the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and in case of Marrying out of their Tribes: And therefore, the Power of Dispensing is justly termed, the highest Prerogative in the King. <hi>Vide</hi> 3 <hi>Inst.</hi> 23. <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 146. 155. 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 35. Nor were Dispensations introduced here by the <hi>Pope,</hi> but the Dispencing Power appertains to the <hi>King</hi> by the Common-Law, in cases of necessity. <hi>Vide</hi> 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 6. <hi>and</hi> 8 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 6. <hi>of Cloath and</hi> 21 <hi>Jac. of Monopolies,</hi> countenances this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censing of <hi>Taverns.</hi> And the Act of Parliament does not limit the King in point of time: And by the same Reason that he has it for life, by the same he may have it as well in perpetuity. <hi>Vide</hi> 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 347. 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 566. Also the number of 40 <hi>Taverns,</hi> is too small for so great a City, and a City which has so vastly encreased since the 7 <hi>of King Ed.</hi> 6. and consequently there is the more reason for the Patent in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. <hi>Vide Dr. and Stud.</hi> 127.</p>
               <pb n="447" facs="tcp:52142:196"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Authorities granted <hi>for life</hi> of the Grantées, and <hi>in perpetuity</hi> have béen held good. For <hi>life</hi> of the parties; <hi>Vide</hi> 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 6. of Sheriffs for life; and for two lives, <hi>Vide Trin.</hi> 15 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>Bridgman's Rep.</hi> 113. upon the <hi>Stat. of</hi> 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. concerning <hi>Wines,</hi> and no exception taken to it. <hi>Vide Dyer</hi> 270. where no time was limited, how long the License was to continue; and therefore, that case does not conclude to ours. And in <hi>Dyer</hi> 92. there wanted the word <hi>Successors. Vide</hi> 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. 11. a like case of a Grant to the City and their Successors by King <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. An Exchequer-Chamber case. And in <hi>Trin.</hi> 2 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. in an Information against <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>&amp; alios</hi> in <hi>B. R.</hi> upon the 7 <hi>of Ed.</hi> 6. the very Point now in question was overruled, upon a Demurrer against the Informer, and upon this Patent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> This is no more than a <hi>License.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> It is more than a License. It is a Liberty to sell Wines, which any man might have done before the 7 <hi>of Ed.</hi> 6. without restraint, as any Man may exercise a lawful Trade: And the Statute, which restrained that liberty, is now let loose by the Patent in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It is an unreasonable Grant, and is therefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed by 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. and is not saved by the <hi>Proviso.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The advantage of the Patent does not accrue <hi>to all</hi> the Citizens in General: But only to those that are bred up to the Trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Cases of <hi>Commissions</hi> and <hi>Protections</hi> have béen objected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> Those things are temporary in their own Nature; and are bare Authorities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The multitude of <hi>Taverns,</hi> which this License gives way to, is a <hi>Common Nusance;</hi> and <hi>Common Nusances</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be dispensed with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> If any such mischief happen, it may be remedied by Enditement. But it is not certain that any such effect will ensue. And the end and design of this <hi>Dispensation</hi> is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a mischief, that was occasioned by the <hi>Stat. of</hi> 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. and not to create a <hi>Nusance,</hi> which by possibility may happen through an abuse of the Liberties hereby granted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> By this Patent the King's Prerogative is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to others, which the Law does not allow of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> No power is hereby transferred; there is but a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty granted to the City of Exercising a Trade, as they might have done before the <hi>Stat. of</hi> 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. And before that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute they might have made Men Frée, as well as they can now.</p>
               <pb n="448" facs="tcp:52142:197"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second Point</hi> is upon the <hi>Statute of</hi> 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. Now it has been resolved in this Court, in <hi>Stephens</hi> and <hi>Duckworth's Case,</hi> that the <hi>Proviso</hi> is effectual to this purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Grantees here are not mentioned in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The <hi>Proviso</hi> does not go by way of Granting an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; but sounds in favour of such as have Advantage, by any former Grant. Nor does it refer to the <hi>Grant</hi> it self, but to <hi>Usage.</hi> And no Citizens used this Priviledge, but the Company of <hi>Vintners</hi> only. And this <hi>Proviso</hi> goes in restraint of the Act, which Act Repealed 7 <hi>of Ed.</hi> 6. without the <hi>Proviso.</hi> And no Clause must be idle in an Act of Parliament, if it may be made good by any reasonable Construction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Patent is <hi>primae Impressionis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> That is not so. Nothing is new, but the calling of it in question. And concluded <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Trin. Term,</hi> 19 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. the case was argued by <hi>Sir Edward Turner pro Quer.</hi> and by <hi>Mr. Mountague pro Defendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Edward Turner:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> These Letters Patents to the City are void. The <hi>Non-obstante</hi> is a Relaxation of, and a Dispensation with the Law; and that Artifice began at <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears 12 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 6. and in <hi>Sir John Davie's Rep.</hi> 69, 71. nor was ever favour'd in our Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Non-obstante</hi> is contrary to those Rules of our Law that are laid down in 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 36. 2 <hi>Ric.</hi> 3. 12. and the Case of <hi>Sheriffs</hi> 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 6. does not prove our Case: For that was but a temporary Dispensation, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> alone was concerned there: But this <hi>Non-Obstante</hi> is prejudicial to the <hi>Subject,</hi> as well as to the <hi>King,</hi> by reason of the large extent of it. <hi>Vide</hi> 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 6. 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 46.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Where a Dispensation proceeds from an <hi>Essential Prerogative</hi> of the Crown, there it is good. <hi>Vide</hi> 7 <hi>Rep. Calvin's Case,</hi> 13 <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6. in case of Murther, and the Case of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. because <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> are the proper Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the <hi>King. Vide</hi> 8 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 146.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But there are also many cases in which the <hi>King</hi> cannot <hi>Dispence:</hi> As, <hi>First,</hi> Where a thing is <hi>malum in se,</hi> and not <hi>malum prohibitum</hi> only. <hi>Vide Sir John Davie's Rep.</hi> 75. 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 3. 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 12. 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 87. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Where the <hi>Subject</hi> is likewise concerned; <hi>Vide</hi> 2 <hi>Ric.</hi> 3. 12. 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 5.
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:52142:197"/> 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 18. 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 18. <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 214. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Where the <hi>King</hi>'s Grant is contrary to the <hi>Common Law,</hi> there a <hi>Non obstante</hi> does not avail; <hi>Vide</hi> 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 35. <hi>Dav. Rep.</hi> 25. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 120. <hi>de Simony, &amp; Plowd. Com.</hi> 502. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Where the Publick Government of the Nation is concerned; as 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 14. of the <hi>Jurisdiction of the Admiralty,</hi> 4 <hi>Instit.</hi> 135. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This Power is not transferrable over, as is done here; 1. In respect of the thing it self: For the Statute of 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi>

                  </gap> and of 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. (as appears by the Preambles) were made to suppress Vice, which is for the benefit of all the Subjects; and by the latitude of this Dispensation it would be in the power of the City to continue the Mischief that was before. And although the <hi>King</hi> may dispence in perpetuity, where he has an Inheritance; yet where he has only a Power and Authority, as here, it is otherwise: <hi>Vide Dyer</hi> 52. <hi>b.</hi> 108. <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 457. <hi>Latch.</hi> 170, 171. <hi>Thuresby's Case.</hi> 2. In respect of the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality of the Grantées; <hi>Vide Hob. Rep.</hi> 230. For any man may be made Frée of the City for 10 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second Point.</hi> If the Patent were good originally, yet it is now void by the Act of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. whereby the Power of granting <hi>Wine-Licenses</hi> is placed in others. It is a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law and concerns the <hi>King</hi>'s Revenue; and must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be expounded beneficially for the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> This Priviledge is preserv'd by the <hi>Saving</hi> in the Act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The <hi>Saving</hi> extends only to the Corporation of <hi>Vintners;</hi> but the Grant here is to the <hi>City;</hi> and the Saving extends only to such Priviledges, as they had <hi>lawfully used;</hi> but this Priviledge was not lawfully used by them, because their Patent for it, was a void Grant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Statutes of <hi>Mortmain</hi> are objected, with which the <hi>King</hi> may dispence, so as to erect a New Corporation, and give them power to purchase Lands, notwithstanding those Statutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> is there concern'd in point of Interest, and that of Inheritance, which is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Presidents have béen urged in 2 <hi>Jac. in B.R.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> There were no such Cases: But in <hi>C. B. rot.</hi> 283. there is a Case, wherein Iudgment was given, as is urged, but it was upon a Demurrer without Argument; and concluded <hi>pro Quer'.</hi>

                  <hi>Mt. Mountague pro Defendente:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Non-obstantes</hi> and <hi>Dispensations</hi> are a Right <hi>inherent</hi> in the <hi>King,</hi> 3 <hi>Inst.</hi> 233. Nor can this be compared to the Cases of <hi>Licenses, Authorities, Commissions, Protections, &amp;c.</hi> granted by the <hi>King:</hi> For they are derivative Powers, and may be Executed by others, and dye with the <hi>King;</hi> and regard his <hi>Natural Capacity.</hi> But a <hi>Dispensation</hi> is a <hi>Flower</hi> of the <hi>Politick Capacity,</hi> which never dies; and therefore no more does a <hi>Dispensation,</hi> if granted for life, till the Death of the Grantée; <hi>Vide Hob. Rep.</hi> 155, 183. 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 36. Nor does the Grant here operate by way of <hi>Transferring</hi> any thing to the City; but by way of <hi>Dispensation;</hi> and though it is not <hi>Transferrable,</hi> yet it is <hi>Dispensable: Vide</hi> 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>Sir John Dav. Rep.</hi> 75. <hi>Stamf.</hi> 101. 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 86. 12 <hi>Rep.</hi> 18, 19. <hi>Dyer</hi> 270. And in <hi>B. C.</hi> 1650. it was held, that such a <hi>Dispensation</hi> as this doth not determine with the life of the <hi>King.</hi> And the Reasons for its Continuance may be these; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>first</hi> may be taken from the Rule laid down in 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 36. <hi>Vide</hi> likewise 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 88. <hi>More's Rep.</hi> 714. 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. 12. 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 3.

So a <hi>Non-obstante</hi> of the Statute of <hi>Mortmain,</hi> granted to a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, extends in perpetuity; <hi>Vide</hi> 4 <hi>Ass. Dyer</hi> 269. <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 457. And in this case of <hi>Mortmain</hi> the <hi>King</hi> has no Title before Forfeiture, but a possibility only; <hi>Vide Mo.</hi> 353. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 512, 513. But I agrée, where the <hi>Publick</hi> is interested, a <hi>Dispensation</hi> is void; as 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 12. but that is not here. And here is no <hi>Transferring</hi> in the case, but a <hi>Relaxation;</hi> and the thing here dispensed with, is not <hi>malum in se,</hi> but is the liberty of the Subject, which he enjoy'd before the <hi>Seventh of Edward the Sixth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Dispensation</hi> is saved by the <hi>Proviso</hi> in 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We are in Effect within the Words of the <hi>Proviso:</hi> As the <hi>Proviso</hi> is worded, it is all one in substance, as if we were within the very letter of it: And they that are by name in the <hi>Proviso</hi> have enjoy'd the Priviledge, ever since the 19th <hi>of Eliz.</hi> Whether such Enjoyment has béen <hi>lawful</hi> or not, depends upon the first Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are at least within the meaning and intent of the <hi>Proviso.</hi> The <hi>Proviso</hi> prevents any prejudice that may accrue by the Act to Corporations, and refers to <hi>Usage.</hi> And the Answer given to the case in <hi>primo Jacobi</hi> 1. comes not up to our case; for the Plea there was grounded upon a Grant
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:52142:198"/> made to the City <hi>in</hi> 9 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which was but <hi>durante beneplacito.</hi> So that a New Grant in <hi>primo Jacobi</hi> was necessary to supply that defect. But our Case depends upon a Patent in 19 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which came not in question there. So he concluded <hi>pro Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente.</hi>

Neither, if the <hi>King</hi> himself were here a Party originally, ought we to be so strict in this case, as in case of an Information of <hi>Intrusion;</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> makes a Title to himself expresly, which he does not here; his only Title here being, that such an one was seised, and became indebted to the <hi>King</hi>'s Debtor: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this case a <hi>Que Estate</hi> may well be pleaded against the <hi>King,</hi> with a <hi>Traverse</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>'s Title found by the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:</hi> Especially when the Defendant has shewn, that such an one was seised in Fée, and conveyed by Lease and Release, &amp;c.
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:52142:199"/>
                  <hi>whose Estate</hi> the Defendant hath; which gives the <hi>King</hi> oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity sufficient to take Issue, or tender an Issue, or to Traverse the Defendant's Title, or the <hi>Que Estate,</hi> which is traversable: And therefore here's no Mischief or Inconvenience to the <hi>King,</hi> as there would be to the <hi>Party,</hi> if he were obliged to set forth all <hi>mean Conveyances,</hi> which perchance it is impossible for him to do; for they may be lost, or detain'd from him by others. And perhaps some, under whom he claims, were seised by <hi>Disseisin;</hi> which it is no good policy to disclose in pleading: But if any were seised by <hi>Usurpation,</hi> it might be safer; for to an <hi>Usurpation</hi> some Legal and Iudicial Acts concur.

               </p>
               <p>The Case was Argued again in <hi>Michaelmass Term, Anno 19 Car. 2.</hi> And upon the Pleadings was thus; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lincoln, 8 Jul. 15 Car. 2. Scire fac.</hi> issued; setting forth, that <hi>Sir George Benion,</hi> the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Receiver,</hi> was indebted to him in divers Sums by reason of his Office.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Roger Fulwood</hi> and <hi>R. Lougher, Esquires, 23 May Anno 14 Car. 1.</hi> were joyntly and severally bound to the said <hi>Sir Geo.</hi> by Bond in <hi>400 l.</hi> to be paid at a day since past; which was assign'd over to the said <hi>King, 12th of October 14 Car. 1.</hi> for and towards the satisfaction of that Debt.</p>
               <p>That the Obligors dying, a <hi>Scire facias</hi> issued against their Executors, Administrators, Heirs and Terre-tenants at the time of the Assignment: And the Sheriff Returned, That he had warned <hi>John Meller,</hi> Tenant of a Messuage and <hi>Forty seven</hi> acres of Pasture in <hi>Silby;</hi> and <hi>Leonard Donington,</hi> Tenant of another Messuage and <hi>Twenty</hi> acres of Land, and <hi>Twenty six</hi> acres of Meadow and Pasture, with the Appurtenances, in <hi>Silby praedict';</hi> and <hi>Thomas Gannock,</hi> Tenant of <hi>Forty</hi> acres of Land, <hi>Sixty</hi> acres of Meadow, and <hi>Twenty</hi> acres of Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>cum pertinent' in <hi>Silby</hi> praedict':</hi> Which said Premisses the said <hi>Lougher</hi> was seised of in Fée at the time of the said Assignment; and because the Premisses were not seised into the <hi>King</hi>'s hands, the Sheriff was commanded to do so by this Writ; and to enquire of, and to return the particular values thereof.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Sheriff did return the Values, and seised the Lands into the <hi>King</hi>'s hands.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Henry Meller</hi> comes in and pleads, that he was hereby aggrieved, and that the Premisses were parcel of the Manor of <hi>Silby;</hi> whereof <hi>Edward Kirton Esq;</hi> was seised in Fée; and being so seised by his Indenture, bearing date the <hi>17th day of May, 20 Jacob.</hi> demised to <hi>Sir John Isham, John Blincoe,</hi> and <hi>Robert Tanfield, Esquires,</hi> for a <hi>Thousand</hi> years, by virtue whereof they Entred and were possessed.</p>
               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:52142:200"/>
               <p>That afterwards the said <hi>Kirton,</hi> by Indenture of Bargain and Sale, dated the <hi>17th of Dec. 22 Jacob.</hi> Enrolled in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> within <hi>six Months, &amp;c.</hi> did in Consideration of <hi>2400 l.</hi> bargain and sell to <hi>John Lougher,</hi> and the said <hi>R. Lougher</hi> and their Heirs, the said Manor with the Appurtenances; by virtue whereof, and of the Statute of <hi>Uses,</hi> they were seised accordingly.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>1st</hi> of <hi>June 14 Car. 1.</hi> the said <hi>John Lougher</hi> died, and <hi>R. Lougher</hi> him survived.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>19th of June, 14 Car. 1.</hi> before the said Assignment by the said <hi>Sir Geo. Benion,</hi> the said <hi>R. Lougher,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Administratrix of the said <hi>John Lougher,</hi> by their Indenture did Release and confirm to the said <hi>Sir John Isham, Blincoe</hi> and <hi>Tanfield,</hi> their Heirs, Executors and Administrators, all their Estate, Right, Title, Interest, Claim and Demand, of and in the said Manor; by virtue whereof they were seised in Fée accordingly.</p>
               <p>That afterward the <hi>17th of Febr. 23 Car. 1.</hi> the said <hi>Blincoe</hi> and <hi>Tanfield</hi> died, and <hi>Sir John Isham</hi> survived; and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the said <hi>Sir John</hi> died, and the Premisses descended upon <hi>Sir Justinian Isham,</hi> as Son and Heir, who entred and was seised; <hi>whose Estate</hi> in the Premisses the said <hi>Henry Meller</hi> hath, and traverseth the Seisin of the said <hi>R. Lougher</hi> at the time of the said Assignment, or at any time after.</p>
               <p>To which Plea the <hi>Attorney General</hi> demurr'd, and the said <hi>Meller</hi> joyn'd in Demurrer.</p>
               <p>The Question was, Whether or no the Conveyance of the Title of the said <hi>Henry Meller,</hi> by a <hi>Que Estate</hi> in Pleading, be good against the <hi>King</hi> in this case. And upon the whole Matter the Case is no more than thus; <hi>viz.</hi> A man pleads, that such a one being indebted to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Receiver,</hi> (who assigns the said Debt to the <hi>King</hi>) and being seised of Lands in Fée, did before the Assignment of the said Debt to the <hi>King,</hi> convey his Estate over to another in Fée, who died, and the Land descended to his Heir, <hi>whose Estate</hi> the Defendant hath.</p>
               <p>And it was argued by the <hi>Attorney General,</hi> that the Plea was not good, for these following Reasons:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> If it were allow'd, it would tend to the diminution of the <hi>King</hi>'s just Prerogative, with respect to his Revenue, which this Court ought to support and preserve.</p>
               <pb n="455" facs="tcp:52142:200"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If this be admitted, it will be mischievous and inconvenient to the <hi>King;</hi> but the contrary will not be so to the Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is beyond all Presidents of Pleading in like cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As this case is, it is against Authorities in our Law.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>first</hi> Ground and Reason: It is the <hi>King</hi>'s undoubted Prerogative,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That he may traverse the Title made for the party, or maintain his own Title at his Election; <hi>3 Hen. 7. 3. 13 Ed. 4. 8. 7 Ed. 6. Br. Traverse 369.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He may waive his Plea or Issue in another Term; the like of his Demurrer, and may joyn Issue, as appears in <hi>28 Hen. 6. 2. 11 Hen. 4. 8, 36, 37, 38. Long Quinto. 118. 5 Rep. 105. Baker's Case.</hi> But after an Issue found he cannot waive it, <hi>9 Hen. 4. 6.</hi> no more can an Informer, <hi>34 Hen. 8. Brook Prerog. 116.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>King</hi> may traverse any part of the Title set up against him by the party, and is not ty'd up as a <hi>Subject</hi> is.</p>
               <p>These being the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Prerogatives,</hi> if the party may make a Title against him by a <hi>Que Estate;</hi> the <hi>King's Prerogative</hi> of traversing any part of the Defendant's Title, will be of little or no advantage to him. For then no Subject would set forth more of his Title than he néeds must, nor more than he would be obliged to do, if another Subject were party: And this forsooth! to avoid prolixity and nicety in pleading, which would reduce all Pleading to this size; <hi>viz.</hi> That such a one was seised in Fée, and enfeoffed such a one, <hi>whose Estate, &amp;c.</hi> Or that such a one was seised in Fée, and died seised, and the Land descended to such a one, <hi>whose Estate, &amp;c.</hi> Which is sufficient in case of a Subject, <hi>7 Ed. 4. 26. b.</hi> And by such a concise way of pleading against the <hi>King,</hi> he will have no benefit of his <hi>Prerogative;</hi> nor will be in any better condition than a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> who must traverse the <hi>Feoffment</hi> or the <hi>Que Estate;</hi> for there will be nothing else for the <hi>King</hi> to traverse. And so the <hi>King</hi> will lose the advantage of that part of his <hi>Prerogative,</hi> to traverse what part of the Defendant's Title he pleases; which in many cases will redound to the diminution of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue. And certainly, the Law hath given the <hi>King</hi> this <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> to better purpose than so; <hi>viz.</hi> that when a Title is set up against him, it should be more full, more certain and direct, than in the case of a <hi>Subject;</hi> as appears by other Cases, <hi>8 Ed. 3. 20. The Abbot of Peterborough's Case:</hi> Where in a
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:52142:201"/>
                  <hi>Replevin</hi> against him for Shéep taken, the <hi>Abbot</hi> Avows as Lord of such a Hundred, and says, That within the said Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred he has a <hi>Franchise</hi> to have <hi>Felons Goods;</hi> and says, that he seized the Goods in question as the Goods of one <hi>Robert de Porter,</hi> who had stolen them and was fled; and so justifies: And this was held to be good, without shewing how or by what means he came to have such a <hi>Franchise.</hi> But if he had claim'd such a <hi>Franchise</hi> in a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> he ought to have shewn <hi>Coment,</hi> and to have convey'd a Title to himself. And so was done in a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> upon a claim of <hi>Conufance of Pleas,</hi> of <hi>Issues</hi> and <hi>Fines, &amp;c. 2 Ed. 3. 29. Roger de Mortimer's Case, Tr. 40 Eliz. Ameredith's Case,</hi> cited <hi>9 Rep. 29.</hi> in the case of the <hi>Abbot of Strata Mercella:</hi> Although the Grants were ancient, and that there had béen many mean Conveyances; yet the Defendant was obliged to convey a particular Title to himself, and not by a <hi>Que Estate,</hi> as here; which, if it be here allowed, will come into fashion, to avoid prolixity in Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>So in an <hi>Information</hi> of <hi>Intrusion,</hi> though the <hi>King</hi> he in possession. And yet in a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> the <hi>King</hi> shews no Title for himself. And in an <hi>Information</hi> of <hi>Intrusion</hi> no Land, no possession is to be recovered: The Iudgment being only <hi>quod Defendens Committatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I said, that such Pleading would be mischievous, and inconvenient to the <hi>King;</hi> but the <hi>Subject</hi> would be at no prejudice, by being obliged to convey to himself a Title in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and that therefore, this President ought not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
               <p>It will be mischievous and inconvenient to the <hi>King,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by this mean the <hi>Kings hands</hi> may be <hi>amoved,</hi> tho' no clear Title appears for the party, and though perhaps he has really none at all. And it has always béen the care of this Court, to preserve and protect the <hi>King's</hi> Revenues, from all such as have not an undoubted Title to them.</p>
               <p>But it will be no mischief to the <hi>Subject,</hi> to oblige him to set forth his Title in particular; for every Man is presumed in Law to be Comisant of his own Title, and to be able to set it forth. For the Evidences of his Estate and Title belong to himself; and therefore it is most consonant to Reason, that he should be compell'd to set it forth, and to draw down parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the whole Title to himself. Vpon this ground it is, that in our Books, <hi>viz. 20 Hen. 7.</hi> it is held that the <hi>King</hi> may be enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled sufficiently by Office upon an Outlawry to an Estate Tail, without shewing the <hi>Commencement</hi> of the Estate Tail; which yet a <hi>Subject</hi> must do, if he will Entitle himself to an Estate
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:52142:201"/> Tail: Because it is his own Estate, and he comes in privity of it, and the Deeds and Evidences that concern it, belong to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It may be mischievous to the <hi>Subject</hi> in many cases, as when some of his Evidences are lost; or detained from him, or mislaid: And perhaps he claims under a <hi>disseizin,</hi> which it is not policy for him to acknowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The like may be objected in all other cases, as in a <hi>Quo Warranto, Information</hi> of <hi>Intrusion, &amp;c.</hi> And this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holds not there. No more ought it to prevail here; where the <hi>King</hi> is seized by a good Title, and comes lawfully to the possession, and the interest of the Revenue is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which is for the publick good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it is the <hi>Subject's</hi> benefit, that is here promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though shrewded under the <hi>King's Prerogative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> This is not to be presumed; because such Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes of Debts to the King, if colourably made, are naught by the <hi>Statute of 21 Jac.</hi> And <hi>de non Apparentibus &amp; non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istentibus eadem est ratio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> It is beyond all Presidents of Pleading; nor (as I am informed) can any one President of this Nature, be found upon search: And it will be of dangerous consequence to the <hi>King</hi> in Point of his Revenue, to introduce such a new sort of pleading; which has not béen known before. And the Argument holds; if there be no <hi>President</hi> of it, then it is not allowable, if it be such a case as may frequently happen. And if it were allowable, there would certainly be <hi>Presidents</hi> found upon search: It is clear in our Books, that as <hi>Presidents</hi> make a Law in a <hi>Court,</hi> so want of <hi>Presidents</hi> (where (as in this case) there is frequent occasion of them administred) is an Argument of a thing's not being allowable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2 Rep. 17. a. Lane's Case.</hi> It is there held, that a Demise for years under the Exchequer-seal, by the word <hi>Commisimus</hi> is a good Lease, by reason of the <hi>multitude of Presidents.</hi> So <hi>contrà</hi> in <hi>Lit. Sect. 107. 108.</hi> Vpon the <hi>Statute of Merton, c. 6.</hi> that if a Lord Marry his Gard to his disparagement, <hi>si pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes conquerantur,</hi> he shall lose his Wardship: It is there said, that no Action lies upon this Law, because it was never séen nor heard, that any such Action had ever béen brought: And if any Action would have lain in that case, it would some time or other have béen put in ure. So I say here; if this were good pleading, there would be <hi>Presidents</hi> of it in Court.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object. 3 Hen. 7. 2</hi> Where a <hi>que Estate</hi> is admitted in such a case as this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> Nothing less, for a <hi>que Estate</hi> cannot be there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The case was in the <hi>Exchequer chamber</hi> before all the Iudges; and it was this, <hi>viz.</hi> It was found by Office, that the <hi>Lord Greystock</hi> was seized in Fée and held of the <hi>King</hi> and died seized, with other circumstances usual in such cases. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon comes another person and says, that the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>York</hi> brought a <hi>Writ of Right</hi> against the said Tenant of the <hi>King,</hi> and recovered against him and entred <hi>diù ante inquisitionem praedictam,</hi> and made a Gift in Tail to <hi>D.</hi> by vertue whereof he was seized, <hi>absque hoc</hi> that the <hi>King's</hi> Tenant died sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
               <p>Now out of this case to deduce a <hi>que Estate,</hi> is without ground and contrary to Law. <hi>First,</hi> Without ground, for there is not the least mention or intimation of a <hi>que Estate</hi> in the case. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is contrary to Law, to make such a construction upon the case, for it is clear in our Books, that a <hi>que Estate</hi> cannot be pleaded of an <hi>Estate Tail,</hi> (as the case there is) nor of any other <hi>particular Estate,</hi> without shewing <hi>coment.</hi> And this appears in <hi>42 Ass. 28. 7 Ed. 6. Br. que E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, 31.</hi> So that that case cannot be made a <hi>President</hi> for ours; and therefore for want of a <hi>President.</hi> I conceive the pleading ought not to be admitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because as this case is, it is contrary to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in Law.</p>
               <p>It is clear in our Books, that a <hi>Plaintiff</hi> cannot make a Title by a <hi>que Estate,</hi> as a <hi>Tenant</hi> may, or one that comes in <hi>the nature of Tenant,</hi> as a <hi>Priee in Aid,</hi> a <hi>Vouchee,</hi> a <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in <hi>Replevin</hi> after <hi>Avowry,</hi> whereby he becomes a <hi>Defendant;</hi> as appears by <hi>2 Hen. 6. 10. 3 Hen. 6. 11, 28. 22 Hen. 6. 13. 50. 9 Ed. 4. 3. 21 Hen. 7. 10. 29 Ass. 19. 18 Ed. 4. 29. 30 Hen. 6. 7.</hi> Now here, as it appears by the Record, <hi>John Meller</hi> and two other persons are returned <hi>Terre-tenants,</hi> and this <hi>Scire-facias</hi> is only to enquire of the value of the Land, and to seize it into the <hi>King's</hi> hand. And therefore <hi>Henry Meller,</hi> who pleads this Plea, and does not so much as name himself Tenant, cannot be Tenant, or presumed so to be against this Record; against which no averment can be taken: And therefore, if it were in the case of a <hi>Common Person,</hi> if he were not Tenant, or did not appear by the Record to be so, he could not plead a <hi>que Estate,</hi> as appears by the Books afore cited. And here he is but as a person, that comes to shew his Right and Interest as <hi>Amicus Curiae;</hi> and if so, it behoves him to shew it precisely and certainly, which he has not done here. And upon these Reasons and
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:52142:202"/> Authorities, I conceive the <hi>Plea</hi> to be naught, and the <hi>Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> good, and pray Iudgment for the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lechemere pro Defendente.</hi> The question is upon the <hi>que Estate.</hi> Which I conceive <hi>Meller</hi> may well plead; for <hi>First,</hi> It is no material part of the Plea: But Entitles him only to contest his Right with the <hi>King. 7 Ed. 4. 26. b. Secondly,</hi> The demand here is not of the Land it self, but only to charge it with a Debt. <hi>Vide 2 Hen. 4. 13. Mich. 36. Eliz. Rot. 203 Exch.</hi> Treasurer's Remembrance upon an Alienation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out License. <hi>Co. Ent. 640.

Sir James Stonehouse's Case.</hi> In case of a <hi>Pardon</hi> or <hi>Discharge,</hi> a Title néeds not be shewn: But if the Title be concern'd, and the Land it self in demand, there a <hi>que Estate</hi> is not sufficient. A <hi>Third</hi> Reason I offer is because it is not Traversable. <hi>7 Ed. 4. 26 Dyer 238.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> A <hi>que Estate</hi> may be pleaded of any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of Fréehold, with an Averment of the life of him, <hi>whose Estate, &amp;c.</hi> and so the Books are to be understood; but not of a Lease for years, because such an Estate cannot be gained but by lawful means. But a <hi>que Estate</hi> cannot be pleaded of <hi>Franchises,</hi> because they are things that <hi>lye in Grant:</hi> But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if they are appurtenant to a Mannor: And so is <hi>Cromp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's Jur' of Courts</hi> to be understood. And the Land is not here in demand any more, than in case of an Alienation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out License. For there the <hi>King</hi> may seize, till the Fine be paid; and he can do no more here, than seize till the Debt be paid. Also a <hi>que Estate</hi> may be pleaded by a Plaintiff, who is a Stranger to the Estate: As when a Lessor brings an Action of Debt, against a third or fourth Assignée of Lessée for years, for Rent Arrere; he may declare upon the Lease made to the first Tenant, <hi>que Estate</hi> the Defendant hath; because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know how the Defendant comes to the Estate, nor by what Conveyances: Not being privy to them. <hi>Et Adjorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Hill. Term Annis 19. and 20 Car. 2.</hi> The case was argued by the <hi>Barons.</hi> And <hi>per Curiam,</hi> the Plea of a <hi>que Estate</hi> is here good <hi>in casu Regis,</hi> for these Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because the <hi>King's</hi> Title is bound by Special Matter before alledged; <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Lease and Release.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because the <hi>que Estate</hi> is but <hi>Conveyance</hi> to the Fréehold, and he that has a Fréehold may plead it, tho' he came to it by <hi>Disseizin: 7 Ed. 6. 26 Dyer 238. Bro. Que Estate 63.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="460" facs="tcp:52142:203"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because the Plea here sounds in <hi>Discharge</hi> of his Lands, and is not for the recovering of any. And <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis Case</hi> in <hi>Co. Entr. 667.</hi> agrées herewith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>King</hi> might <hi>Travers</hi> it. <hi>9 Hen. 7. 14. 19 Hen. 6. 56.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Debt here is but a Debt due to the <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Assignment,</hi> which is not of such consideration in the Eye of the Law, as a Debt <hi>Originally</hi> due to the <hi>King. Vide Co. Jurisd. of Courts 115.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The pleadfng here is unusual, he does not plead himself <hi>Terre-tenant,</hi> bue he is only found so by others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> So it was in <hi>Courtney's Case,</hi> and he is admitted so to be; and the same is held for Law in <hi>Co. Jurisdict of Courts 198.</hi> and Iudgment was given accordingly.</p>

And it would be hard to bind persons in possession, who have a Title and were not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Information; for by that mean any man might be stripp't of a lawful possession.

And the mischief would be great, if such Iudgment were conclusive to <hi>Strangers:</hi> At that rate no man would be safe, tho' he had never so much right, and were in possession.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>North pro Defendente. First,</hi> It is consonant to natural reason, that when a person comes in by Title, as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The Wife of a Dissessor, there should be no entry up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such person; for that they come in by Act of Law, and so are Priviledged. <hi>A fortiori</hi> in case of the <hi>Kings Prerogative</hi> for there the Law presumes a Title, especially where the <hi>King</hi> claims <hi>Jure Coronae:</hi> Otherwise, where the King claims by Purchase, or is seized by Tort: For there he is not Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. <hi>Vide</hi> 4 <hi>Rep. the case of the Comminalty of Sadlers; and Stamford's Prerogative, Title, Petition:</hi> And it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise likewise, when the Subjects Title is found by the same Office, which Entitles the King. For there an <hi>Amoveas manum</hi> lies; and an Entry upon the <hi>King's</hi> Patentée: But no such thing appears in our case.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Consideration may be taken from the nature of a Iudgment in <hi>Intrusion:</hi> Which is as strong for the <hi>King,</hi> as a Iudgment in a <hi>Real Action.</hi> For the Information shews a Title for the <hi>King,</hi> and the Iudgment in it is, that the Lands be seized into the <hi>King's</hi> Hands; and other Real Action the <hi>King</hi> can have none, because he cannot be <hi>Disseized.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be hard upon the <hi>King,</hi> if having no other mean to recover, he should not have the same benefit of his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a Subject would have of his in a Real Action. <hi>Vide</hi> the Iudgment in an Information of <hi>Intrusion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thrée things are Objected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This Iudgment ought not to bind a <hi>Stranger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Tenant of the Fréehold is not made <hi>party</hi> to the Information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Tenant of the Fréehold was in possession, at the time of the preferring the Information, and is found to have béen so.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>First</hi> I answer, that there is a diversity betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Common Person:</hi> for a man cannot <hi>falsifie</hi> a Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very at the suit of the <hi>King,</hi> tho' had by consent. <hi>Stamf. Prer.</hi> 74.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Second,</hi> An <hi>Information</hi> is not like an <hi>Assize,</hi> which must be brought against the <hi>Terre-tenant:</hi> It sufficeth, if the Information be brought against the <hi>pernor of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,</hi> be he Tenant or no: Because no possession can be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>King,</hi> as from a <hi>Common person.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="462" facs="tcp:52142:204"/>
               <p>To the <hi>Third,</hi> An <hi>Actual</hi> possession is not found, and it may well be understood of a <hi>possession in Law,</hi> and shall be so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed here for the <hi>King. Vide</hi> 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 2. and concluded <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> It cannot be maintained, that such a Iudgment shall bind a Stranger, for then would this become a trap to catch any Man's possession by lawful Title: And it would be of very ill consequence, especially considering that in this case, others are found to be in possession. And they that take the profits shall not be presumed to be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and if they shall be so presumed, yet themseves only, and such as claim under them shall be bound by the Iudgment. And though the Iudgment in <hi>Intrusion</hi> includes an <hi>Amoveas manum,</hi> yet it extends only to such, as may lawfully be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. And if the Sheriff do otherwise, he is a Disseizor; as if in a Iudgment against <hi>A,</hi> in a Real Action, he should oust <hi>B,</hi> who neither claims under <hi>A,</hi> nor is Tenant to the Action. And the <hi>King</hi> cannot gain any thing by wrong; so that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Disseizor, but they that enter. And the Iudgment in <hi>Intrusion,</hi> is not in the nature of a <hi>Seizin</hi> or <hi>Possession,</hi> but only <hi>quod pars committatur &amp; capiatur pro fine.</hi> And upon that an <hi>Injunction</hi> issues for the possession against the party himself, and all claiming under him. And tho' a <hi>Petition of Right</hi> lies against the <hi>King</hi> in this case, yet when the <hi>King</hi> has granted the Land over, an Entry may be made upon his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentée. <hi>Vide</hi> 11 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. Nor does an Information of <hi>Intrusion</hi> suppose the <hi>King</hi> out of possession, for that would be contrary to the purport of the <hi>Writ,</hi> which supposeth that the party intruded upon the <hi>King's</hi> possession.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(3)"/> IN <hi>Debt upon an Obligation,</hi> Conditioned to appear before the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> The case was; They had voted one <hi>Wogan</hi> Guilty of <hi>High-Treason,</hi> and the Plaintiff being a <hi>Serjeant at Arms</hi> attending upon the House, was Ordered to take the said <hi>Wogan</hi> into Custody; who being taken into Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by vertue of that Warrant, the Defendant entred into this Bond to the Plaintiff, conditioned for the said <hi>Wogan's</hi> appearance, who did not appear. And hereupon Debt being brought, the chief question upon a Demurrer was, whether this were a void Bond or no.</p>
               <p>And <hi>per Curiam,</hi> it is <hi>void</hi> by the <hi>Common-Law,</hi> for it was entred into for <hi>ease and favour</hi> of the Prisoner: And it is no more than a Bond to a Sheriff, to answer for an Escape. And here <hi>Wogan</hi> was taken into Custody for <hi>Treason,</hi> for which he
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:52142:205"/> could not be <hi>Bailed:</hi> Otherwise, if it were for an Offence bailable. But the <hi>Court</hi> agreed, that the Plaintiff was not an Officer within the Statute of 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. so that the said Statute did not make void this Bond. But then it was urged, that the Condition which recites the Bond to have been entred into for <hi>Appearance</hi> only, is an <hi>Estoppel</hi> to the parties to say, that it was given for any other cause. To which the <hi>Court</hi> said, that here was no <hi>Estoppel;</hi> for an Estoppel in such cases, is always when the Bond is a <hi>good</hi> Bond; then indeed the Recital is an <hi>Estoppel:</hi> But when the <hi>Bond</hi> is <hi>void,</hi> the <hi>Estoppel</hi> is <hi>void</hi> too, and does not bind the parties: As if in a Case upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. or the <hi>Statute of Usury,</hi> the Condition of the Bond should recite some Matter that makes the Bond good; yet if in truth the <hi>Contract</hi> were Vsurious, or the <hi>Condition</hi> not within the Statute of 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 10. and that be pleaded, it will avoid the Bond and the Estoppel too. So here likewise, the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff by his Demurrer has admitted the Matter of Fact, which the Defendant alledgeth in his Plea; to wit, that it was for <hi>Treason.</hi> And Iudgment was given accordingly, <hi>Nisi causa, &amp;c.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>IN a Bill to <hi>redeem a Mortgage,</hi> the Case appear'd to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(4)"/> thus; <hi>viz.</hi> the Plaintiff had mortgaged Lands in Fée to one <hi>Ludlow</hi> for security of 3000 <hi>l.</hi> with Interest, and bound himself in a Statute and Recognizance to perform the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the Mortgage, and to pay the Mony with Interest at a certain day. The day past, the Mony unpaid. The <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagee</hi> by his Will devised all his Goods, Chattels, Debts, and personal Estate, his Debts and Legacies being paid, to his Executor, and dies: <hi>Edmund Ludlow,</hi> Son and Heir of the Mortgagée is attainted of <hi>High Treason</hi> by the New Act of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. The <hi>King</hi> seizes; and the Executor extends the Plaintiff's Lands upon the Recognizance, who thereupon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits his Bill against the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Executor,</hi> and in it sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests, that he could not pay the Mony at the day at the place appointed, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Strand in Middlesex,</hi> by reason of the Plague; and that afterwards the Mortgagée accepted the Interest, and waived the Forfeiture: And the Question now upon a Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the Bill was, whether or no the Plaintiff could have any <hi>Remedy against the King, to have a Redemption?</hi> And it
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:52142:206"/> was said for the <hi>King,</hi> that he could not. But that he must prefer his <hi>Petition of Grace and Favour.</hi> For a <hi>Mortgage</hi> is in the nature of a <hi>Trust</hi> betwixt the Mortgageor and Mortgagée; and no more than the <hi>King</hi> can be seized to an Vse, or in trust for another, so as to have remedy against the <hi>King</hi> for it; <hi>Dyer</hi> 8. 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 27. no more is there any remedy against him to redéem a mortgaged Estate. Also the <hi>King</hi> cannot be compell'd to Execute any Conveyances; and although the ordinary process of the Court may be stay'd in case of a Chattel, as when a Trustée for years is Outlaw'd, for the benefit of the <hi>Cestuy que Trust;</hi> yet it is otherwise in case of a Fée and Fréehold, as here. For though the <hi>Cestuy que Use</hi> of a term for years may forfeit it for Felony; yet a <hi>Cestuy que Trust</hi> in Fée cannot. And all the New Acts of <hi>Treason</hi> have especial <hi>Provisoes</hi> for this purpose, to be relieved against the <hi>King;</hi> which shews, that they thought the parties not safe without them.</p>
               <p>On the other side, it was said by those who were of Counsel for the Plaintiff and Executor, That <hi>Natural Equity,</hi> such as in this case, was <hi>Natural Justice;</hi> and that an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that should take it away, would be void in it self; as is said in <hi>Doctor &amp; Stud.</hi> And no more than the <hi>King</hi> can deny <hi>Justice</hi> in his own case, no more can he deny <hi>Common Equity;</hi> and <hi>Common Equity</hi> is as due to the <hi>Subject</hi> against the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>Justice</hi> is. There is more than a <hi>Trust</hi> in this case; the party here has an Interest <hi>sub modo, viz.</hi> to have a Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor do the mortgaged Lands here come to the Crown <hi>Jure Praerogativae,</hi> but by <hi>Escheat,</hi> as he is <hi>Lord Paramount,</hi> and the Lands held of him. And as well as a Bill to <hi>redeem a Mortgage</hi> lies against a <hi>Lord by Escheat,</hi> so well does it lye against the <hi>King.</hi> A Lord that has Land by <hi>Escheat,</hi> has it not méerly in the <hi>Post.</hi> And as a Bill to redéem lies against the Conisée of a Statute, who extends for a Debt due from the Mortgagée, or against a <hi>Tenant in Dower;</hi> so does it lye against a <hi>Lord by Escheat,</hi> and by 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. If there be the <hi>King,</hi> Lord, Mesne and Tenant, and the Tenant be attainted of <hi>Treason;</hi> although the Mesnalty be Extinct, yet if there be a Rent by Surplusage, that remains, and shall be paid to the Mesne, and he shall have remedy for it here by the course of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> And it would fall out to be very inconvenient, if it were otherwise; if the coming of Lands into the <hi>King</hi>'s hands should discharge the <hi>equity of Redemption,</hi> where there is no wilful default in the party; but it is the Act of God only, as in this case, and the cases of <hi>Cestuy que Trust</hi> for years above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron:</hi> This is a case of great concern, and deserves great consideration. It was made a Question in this present Parliament in the House of Lords, in the <hi>Earl of Cleveland's Case; First,</hi> Whether or no there be a right of <hi>Redemption</hi> in this case against the <hi>King?</hi> And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> if there be, what Remedy must be taken? And I answered, as I take the Law to be, that in Natural Iustice <hi>Redemption of a Mortgage</hi> lies against the <hi>King.</hi> But to the other Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion I made no answer; because I took it to be a Point of great importance. But I am of Opinion, that the <hi>King</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compell'd to reconvey; but that an <hi>Amoveas manum</hi> only lies in such case. And this is all that can be done, if a Trustee forfeit the Estate. And it is to be considered here, whether or no there be a right of <hi>Redemption</hi> against the <hi>Lord by Escheat</hi> (for so the <hi>King</hi> is in here, and not by his <hi>Prerogative</hi>) and how the <hi>Course of Chancery</hi> is in case of the <hi>Redemption of Mortgages,</hi> who shall redeem, and against whom. I agrée the case of a <hi>Statute Merchant;</hi> for he comes in meerly by the party, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Act of the party, and the Remedy that the Law gives thereupon; and it is worth enquiring how the Presidents are, where a Trustée for years is Outlaw'd, and the Lands seized, what remedy the <hi>Cestuy que Trust</hi> has there? But admitting that case, yet it may be otherwise in case of a Fée simple; as <hi>Cestuy que Trust</hi> for years may forfeit his Interest for <hi>Felony;</hi> but <hi>Cestuy que Trust</hi> in Fée cannot; and I agrée the case in 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. And I conceive, that a <hi>Mortgage</hi> is not meerly a <hi>Trust;</hi> but a <hi>Title in Equity.</hi> And the Matter of <hi>Redemption,</hi> it seems, is not the main business in the case; for <hi>Mr. Attorney General</hi> offers to give way to a Redemption, upon payment of the Mony: But the Point is, who shall have the Mony, whether the Executor and Devisee, or the King? for both contend for it.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Chief Baron</hi> further said; If the Condition of a Mortgage be to Reenter upon payment of the Mony to the Executors, or Administrators, there without doubt the Heir should not have the Mony after forfeiture; because the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagee look'd upon it only as a Chattel; though if the word <hi>Heirs</hi> were inserted into the Condition, it would be more a Question. But he said, he took the Law to be the same in both cases. Yet he delivered no Opinion in the Principal case; but ordered a Case to be made of it. And the Cause was <hi>Adjourned.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="468" facs="tcp:52142:207"/>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Hillary Term, in Annis</hi> 19 <hi>&amp;</hi> 20 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. it was argued again by Counsel on both sides; and much to the same effect as before. And the <hi>King</hi>'s Counsel insisted, that a Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageor was not relievable against the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>equity:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because the <hi>King</hi> is not liable to a <hi>Trust;</hi> and a Mortgage forfeited is of the same nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because by the <hi>Escheat</hi> the ancient Right and Tenure is destroy'd, and the <hi>King</hi> is in <hi>Jure Coronae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Estates in <hi>Dower, Frank-bank, Tenancies by the Courtesie,</hi> and of <hi>Disseisors,</hi> are not liable to <hi>Trusts,</hi> because they are in the <hi>Post;</hi> otherwise of <hi>Occupancies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Chancery</hi> has no Iurisdiction over the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Conscience,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> but over the <hi>Consciences of Subjects</hi> only: For that it is a Power delegated by the <hi>King</hi> to the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> to exercise the <hi>King</hi>'s Equitable Authority betwixt Subject and Subject. Nor is it within the Statute of 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 39. for Equity against the <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> And they cited <hi>Dyer</hi> 8. 283. <hi>Lane's Rep.</hi> 54. <hi>Yelv.</hi> 115. <hi>Lane's Rep. Bowle's Case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Plaintiff's Counsel urged, that Relief lay:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Although it did not lye, yet it is reasonable the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney General</hi> should answer; and the Matter in Law be respited till the Hearing of the Cause upon the Proofs; as is usually done in cases of Demurrers, for Difficulty of the Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> An Equity of Redemption is now of so great esteem in the Law, that it is assignable and devisable; and an <hi>Occupant,</hi> a <hi>Tenant in Frank-Bank, &amp;c.</hi> as was held in <hi>Draper's Case,</hi> shall be liable to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Many persons are liable in <hi>Equity</hi> notwithstanding the Forfeitures of Mortgages, who are not liable to <hi>Trusts:</hi> As when a Corporation makes a Lease, rendring Rent, with a Clause of Reentry; and the Lease comes to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited through Casualty or Mischance, as in 39 <hi>Eliz. Throgmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Finche's Case.</hi> Nor is the loss of the Seignory any Objection here: For as in case of a Lord, Mesne and Tenant, If the Seignior purchase the Tenancy, the Mesnalty is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, but the Mesne shall have the Rent by surplusage. So it is in the <hi>King</hi>'s Case, 6 <hi>Rep. Sir John Molin's Case.</hi> And the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty shall be revived by the <hi>King</hi>'s Granting over; and they cited the Books of 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 4, 5. 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 25. <hi>Litt.</hi> 339, 340. <hi>Dyer</hi> 360.</p>
               <pb n="469" facs="tcp:52142:207"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron:</hi> There is a Diversity betwixt a <hi>Trust</hi> and a power of <hi>Redemption;</hi> for a <hi>Trust</hi> is created by the Contract of the party, and he may direct it as he pleaseth; and he may provide for the Execution of it, and therefore one that comes in in the <hi>Post</hi> shall not be liable to it without express mention made by the party; and the Rules for Executing a <hi>Trust</hi> have often varied, and therefore they only are bound by it, who come in in <hi>Privity of Estate.</hi> A <hi>Tenant in Dower</hi> is bound by it, because she is in in the <hi>Per,</hi> but not a <hi>Tenant by the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,</hi> who is in the <hi>Post.</hi> So all who come in in <hi>Privity of Estate,</hi> or with <hi>Notice,</hi> or without a <hi>Consideration.</hi> But a Power of <hi>Redemption</hi> is an <hi>equitable Right</hi> inherent in the Land, and binds all persons in the <hi>Post,</hi> or otherwise. Because it is an <hi>Ancient Right,</hi> which the party is Entitled to in <hi>Equity.</hi> And although by the <hi>Escheat</hi> the Tenure is extinguish'd, that will be nothing to the purpose, because the party may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd for that by the Court, by a Decrée for Rent, or part of the Land it self, or some other satisfaction. And it is of such consideration in the Eye of the Law, that the Law takes notice of it, and makes it assignable and devisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>But the most considerable things in the Case are:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>King</hi> is in actual Possession, and cannot be removed in equity by an <hi>Amoveas manum,</hi> as he may at Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether there will not be a diversity betwixt the Estate of a <hi>Ward</hi> and an <hi>Escheat:</hi> For in Cases of <hi>Wardships,</hi> the <hi>Court of Wards</hi> had Iurisdiction by the 33<seg rend="sup">th</seg> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. but in this case here is an actual Inheritance in the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Statute of</hi> 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 39. is to be considered, which gives <hi>Relief in equity</hi> against the <hi>King.</hi> And I conceive clearly, that in this case the Executor would be relieved against the Heir for the Mony; because in common estimation it is but a personal Estate.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Baron Atkyns</hi> was strongly of Opinion, that the party ought in this case to be relieved against the <hi>King,</hi> because the <hi>King</hi> is the Fountain and Head of Iustice and Equity; and it shall not be presumed, that he will be defective in either. And it would derogate from the <hi>King</hi>'s Honour to imagin, that what is Equity against a Common person, should not be Equity against him.</p>

Currier</hi> preferr'd a Bill in the <hi>Exchequer-Chamber,</hi> against the Plaintiffs and others, Tenants of a Mannor of the <hi>Countess of Pembrokes,</hi> for <hi>Suit to his Mill,</hi> which he claimed by <hi>Prescription;</hi> many Witnesses were Examined on both sides: And now upon this Bill preferr'd against the <hi>Countess</hi> and <hi>Currier,</hi> a Trial at Law being directed to try the Title, the <hi>Countess</hi> would make use at the Trial betwixt <hi>Currier</hi> and her self, of the <hi>former Depositions</hi> taken, <hi>ut suprà;</hi> and that being deny'd her, she now appeal'd to the <hi>Court</hi> for Directions in the Matter, and pray'd a <hi>New Trial.</hi> The Court was of Opinion, That the former Depositions ought not to be made use of at the Trial, because the <hi>Countess</hi> was not a party to that Suit; and as they could not be read against her, no more could they be read for her: And because she was not bound by them, not having béen a party to the Suit; nor was she in a Capacity of Examining any Witness in it, or preferring Interrogatories in it; for that Reason also she could not make use of the Depositions of any that had béen a Witness in it. And it is not like to the Case of an <hi>Ejectment,</hi> brought by a <hi>Reversioner,</hi> or <hi>Debt</hi> upon the Statute of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. brought by a Proprietor of <hi>Tithes,</hi> after a Verdict at Law for the Lessée or the present Proprietor: For true it is, that such a <hi>Reversioner</hi> of Lands or Tithes shall have advantage of the Verdict, and give it in Evidence; but the Reasons are, because they cannot be immediate parties to the Action or Suit; for that must be prosecuted by the Lessée or present Tenant: And likewise because they may give any thing in Evidence to the Iury, as well as the Plaintiff himself: And Kindred or Affinity to the <hi>Reversioner,</hi> is a good cause of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge; but it is otherwise in case of <hi>Depositions.</hi> For there only parties to the Suit can Examine or Interrogate. Likewise
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:52142:209"/> the Reversioner or the Seignoresse might have béen made a party to the Original suit in Equity, tho' not at Law. And it was ruled accordingly, that the Depositions should not be made use of.</p>

Hereupon the Owners of the thrée parts Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the Iudge of the Admiralty, against the Owner of the fourth part, to compel his Assent: But the Iudge would not compel him. But the Court of Admiralty by way of Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, took a Recognisance of 200 <hi>l.</hi> penalty to the use of <hi>Jenoways,</hi> that the Ship should return from the intended Voyage within Eightéen Months, or else that the Owners of the thrée parts, should pay the Owner of the fourth part, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of his fourth part.

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctor Walker</hi> moved against the Prohibition, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself upon the great mischief and inconvenience that would ensue, if it should be in the power of one man of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to hinder Trade and Navigation. By that mean all Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation might be destroyed, which would tend to the Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Common-wealth. And for the Advancement of that the Court of Admiralty has used time out of mind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, to make such <hi>Stipulations</hi> upon a Petition in Vacation time, which is in the nature of a Suit in such cases. And for the other Objections, he said, they were so many mistakes in the <hi>Suggestion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Chief Baron</hi> said, that the Objection drawn from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience and Antiquity, was of no great Force; for the same Objection might be made in case of <hi>Charter-parties,</hi> and <hi>Contracts made upon Lands</hi> for Freight and Voyages; and yet the Court of <hi>Admiralty,</hi> has nothing to do in those cases. By the <hi>Statute of</hi> 15 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. nothing transacted upon Land or <hi>infrà Corpus Com.</hi> is to be tried in the <hi>Admiralty;</hi> and usage before or after, will not take away the Force and Effect of an Act of Parliament. And here the Ship being <hi>infrà Corpus Comitatûs,</hi> the Admiralty has nothing to do with it, nor any part of it, no more than in other cases arising ashore. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, this Recognisance séems to be void: For it is not in the nature of Bail, to compel a person to appear to an Action, and <hi>stare Judicio,</hi> but by way of Stipulation and contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen the parties, nor is it an Incident to, or dependant upon any Suit there: For if so, perhaps it might be good, if it were usually taken: And suppose in this case, that he who has but a fourth part, would set fire to the Ship; there would be no remedy in the Admiralty. Neither is there any remedy there, if he will not consent, so long as the Ship is <hi>infra Corpus Comitatûs;</hi> but if it were <hi>super altum mare,</hi> the case would be different. And the usage of the Court of Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in such cases is nothing to the purpose. For it is very well known, that the Ordinary has used time out of mind to cause an Administrator to make Distribution: And Presidents have béen cited for it, from the time of <hi>King Kanute,</hi> and so downwards: And yet the Court of King's Bench Grants <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> and denies a <hi>Consultation,</hi> because by the <hi>Statute of Ed.</hi> 3. it is within the conusance of the <hi>Common Law,</hi> so here. Besides, if there be but <hi>Probabilis causa</hi> for a Prohibition, it must not be denied <hi>ex debito Justiciae;</hi> for if it be granted where it ought not, the adverse party has remedy by <hi>Consultation,</hi> or other means to relieve himself against it: But if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, where it is grantable, the party is without remedy. But
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:52142:210"/> because this was a case of great consequence, and no Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was shewn of any Prohibition granted in such case, time was given to the <hi>first Saturday</hi> in <hi>Easter-Term,</hi> to advise upon the matter; and in the mean time all procéedings in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty were to stay by consent.</p>

And then the Defendants preferred their Bill in the <hi>Chancery</hi> of <hi>Dover</hi> within the <hi>Cinque Ports,</hi> suggesting that there is and had béen <hi>temps dont, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>St. John's</hi> a <hi>Pier</hi> called <hi>Margaret-Pier,</hi> and that the <hi>Pier-wardens</hi> had used time out of mind to dig there for Gravel, Sand, &amp;c. for repairing the <hi>Pier,</hi> and for the safety and preservation of Ships and Shipping; and that by several Orders and Decrées of the <hi>Lords Wardens</hi> of the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> it had béen so ordered and put in Execution: And to have the benefit of that Custom, and of those Orders and Decrées, and to stop further procéedings at Law, was the scope of the Bill. To which the Now Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff answered, denying that he knew any thing of such Custom or of such Orders. And upon hearing of the Cause in that Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> upon Proofs the Plaintiff <hi>Sir John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi> was decreed not to procéed in his cause here; and to pay 13 <hi>l.</hi> costs to the Defendants; upon which he prayed a <hi>Prohibition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>per Curiam</hi> a <hi>Prohibition</hi> lies: For it is not in the power of any inferior Court to stay procéedings in a cause, that is first Attacht there: And a <hi>Quo minus</hi> lies in the <hi>Cinque-ports,</hi> as well as within a <hi>County-Palatine,</hi> or in <hi>Wales:</hi> And rather in the <hi>Cinque-ports</hi> than in <hi>County-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine;</hi> because a <hi>County-Palatine</hi> has <hi>Jura Regalia</hi> within it self. And it is usual to Grant <hi>Prohibitions</hi> into <hi>County-Palatines.</hi> And so it was done last Term, to the <hi>County-Palatine</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> upon a suit commenced here by <hi>Quo minus:</hi> And afterwards, a Bill preferred there to stay it. And so it would be if a suit were commenced in the <hi>Admiralty</hi> there against Law, a <hi>Prohibition</hi> would lie: And the <hi>King's Debtor</hi> has the same Priviledge that the <hi>King</hi> has, to sue for his Debt where he will. It would else be very inconvenient, if a private juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:52142:211"/> might do what they would, and there would be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy elsewhere. And <hi>Yelv. Rep.

               <p>The Defendants perceiving the Opinion of the Court, offered to succease further procéedings in the <hi>Chancery</hi> of the <hi>Cinque-Ports;</hi> and to go to Tryal upon the Custom in this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, having liberty to alter their Plea, and to plead the Custom; and so it was ordered.</p>

               <p>He conceived that if an Vnjust-seizure were made, yet if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward an Information were preferr'd for the same goods, and they condemned upon it, this would excuse the Seizure, tho' by a Verdict afterwards it should be found, that the goods were not well Seized. But if a Seizure be made for a just cause, and there be no due procéedings thereupon according to Law, an Action upon the case lies: Now here whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedings are just, and such as may be maintained, the question depends upon the said Acts, and some Clauses therein: The Act of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. imposes no certain Forfeiture in such case, but provides for the payment of the Duty before Landing. But about Brewers and Retailers, many Penalties are inflicted, And then there is a Clause <hi>that such Forfeitures and Offences,</hi>

                  <hi>Ayloff pro Quer.</hi> He argued much to the same purpose, that the Council for the Plaintiff had argued in the former case: That they had but a limited Iurisdiction; which if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded, their Acts were void; and their other Officers lyable. And he cited the case of <hi>Callicoe,</hi> which the Farmers of the Customs had adjudged to be <hi>Linnen,</hi> and yet the contrary had béen ajudged here. And two Courts may have Iurisdiction in a cause <hi>diverso respectu:</hi> If <hi>Right of Tithes</hi> come in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, the <hi>Spiritual Court</hi> had a Iurisdiction; if a <hi>Discharge
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:52142:213"/> of Tithes,</hi> the Common Law has; <hi>Vide Mo. Rep.</hi> 42. <hi>Cardinal Pool's Case, &amp; vide Cro. Car.</hi> 395. the case of a Iustice of Peace; where an Officer was held liable to an Action for taking a Distress pursuant to his Warrant, in case of a Cess rated upon one that was not liable; <hi>Vide Dyer</hi> 135.</p>
               <p>But the main Doubt here is, because the <hi>Statute</hi> gives an <hi>Appeal;</hi> whence they would infer, that the party has no other Remedy. To which I answer, That the words <hi>[and not otherwise]</hi> relate only to the <hi>proximum antecedens;</hi> and the meaning of them is, that the <hi>Commissioners of Appeal</hi> shall procéed only in cases of <hi>Appeal,</hi> and not originally. And tho' the Act be restrictive with respect to the Commissioners and Iustices of Peace, who have a stinted Authority; yet it was not the Intention of the Makers of the Act, to exclude the Iurisdiction of the Common Law. And the <hi>Act</hi> of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. which gives the Hereditary Excise, concerns other matters, that are not determinable before the <hi>Commissioners of Excise;</hi> as Purveyance, &amp;c. <hi>Vide Cro. Eliz.</hi> 38 <hi>Eliz. Placito</hi> 7 <hi>Dyer</hi> 236. And the Act gives leave to plead the <hi>General Issue;</hi> which implies, that the Matter is examinable elsewhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Winnington pro Defendente:</hi> The Officers in this case are excus'd, because the Liquor is an Excisable Liquor: Otherwise, if the Liquor were not Excisable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> An Action lies not against the <hi>Commissioners;</hi> because they are <hi>Judges,</hi> and by consequence not against their Officers neither. For the Power of the Commissioners, <hi>vide</hi> the words of the <hi>Act</hi> of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. The Procéedings here are according to the <hi>Act</hi> by Information, and Iudgment has pass'd upon the Information after Witnesses examined, which is in the nature of a Trial. And, if being mistaken in Iudgment, shall be held a sufficient ground of Action, it will be hard upon the Iudges in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> and elsewhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I agrée an Action may lie, if they have no Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Cause; but if they have a Iurisdiction, it lies not: 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 86, 87. And though here they have erred in Matter of Fact; yet being made Iudges of that by the Statute, no Action lies against them; <hi>Vide Co.</hi> 12 <hi>Rep.</hi> 23, 24. Conspiracy lies not against a Iuror for Matter of Fact; and many good Cases are there put; no more does an <hi>Action</hi> lye here. And this Case differs from all that have been cited of <hi>Sewers, Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, &amp;c.</hi> For here a <hi>Judicatory</hi> is erected, and an <hi>Appeal</hi> given from it; which is not in those other Cases.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If they be not <hi>Strong-Waters,</hi> they are not within their Iurisdiction, and then they are Trespassors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> If that appear to them upon the Information or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord before them, I agree they are Trespassors; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, I deny it. For the <hi>Commissioners</hi> can know what they are no otherwise; and their Iudgment is equivalent to a Verdict, and therefore it would be unreasonable to punish their Officers; <hi>Vide Nudigate's Case, cited in Co.</hi> 12 <hi>Rep.</hi> 23. Nor is it found here, that they did this <hi>falsly</hi> or <hi>corruptly;</hi> and if the Masters are not guilty, no more are their Servants. And he concluded <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron:</hi> The Procéeding here is <hi>Civilitèr,</hi> not <hi>Criminalitèr,</hi> as in the Case cited out of 12 <hi>Co.</hi> But the case of a Iustice of Peace séems to come full up to ours; for the Iustice had a Iurisdiction, but he kept not within it. And suppose the <hi>Commissioners</hi> should adjudge Small-Béer or Water, to be Strong-Béer, it would be mischievous if the Subject in such a case should have no Action upon a Distress taken for a Forfeiture. And where the Iurisdiction it self is stinted and Examinable, there their <hi>Acts</hi> are so too; and their Iudgment is no <hi>Estoppel,</hi> if the Matter be not within their Iurisdiction, which is a particular and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed one. <hi>Et Adjornatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Hillary Term,</hi> 20 <hi>&amp;</hi> 21 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. the <hi>Barons</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Opinions <hi>seriatim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Rainesford pro Quer':</hi> But yet he held, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants might well enough have Iustified by virtue of an Authority from the <hi>Commissioners of Excise,</hi> who are Iudges of the Fact; and that their Authority is not traversable by the Plaintiff; <hi>Vide</hi> 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 121. <hi>Fitzh. Barr</hi> 271. And that the Plaintiff here must have taken his Remedy by <hi>Appeal,</hi> and no otherwise; as appears 8 <hi>Rep. Dr. Bonham's Case.</hi> But the Case of <hi>Bankrupts</hi> is different, for there no Writ of <hi>Error</hi> or <hi>Appeal</hi> is given by the Statute. And upon the 18th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> an Order for Maintaining a Bastard-Child is not traversable, because the party may have his <hi>Appeal.</hi> But if the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi> excéed their Authority, and that appear to the <hi>Court,</hi> then their Procéedings are <hi>Coram non Judiee,</hi> and an <hi>Action</hi> of <hi>Trespass</hi> lies; <hi>Vide Rol.</hi> 869. 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 32. But if that does not appear, it will be otherwise. And in our Case it appears by the <hi>Special Verdict,</hi> that the Commissioners have excéeded their Authority, in adjudging <hi>Low-Wines</hi> to be <hi>Strong-Waters</hi> perfectly made, which are of another <hi>Species.</hi> And certainly, if the Commissioners would adjudge <hi>Rose-water</hi> to be <hi>Strong-Waters,</hi>
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:52142:214"/> they would excéed the Power given them by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; and then both themselves and their Officers, who should levy any thing by virtue thereof, would be <hi>Trespassers; Vide</hi> 10 <hi>Rep. the Case of the Marshalsea.</hi> And the Reason is, because when they exceed their authority, they cease to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, and act as Private persons; <hi>Vide Cro. Car.</hi> 355. and <hi>Rol.</hi> 560. 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 100. <hi>Rook's Case.</hi> And tho' the Plaintiff could not <hi>Traverse,</hi> yet the <hi>Jury</hi> would not be <hi>estopp'd,</hi> 2 <hi>Rep. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard's Case,</hi> 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 52. <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 514. 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. and the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Matter may be found, as in <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> 110. So he concluded <hi>pro Quer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Turner pro Quer':</hi> He argued much to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; insisted upon the Commissioners having a <hi>Limited Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> and no Iurisdiction at all in case of <hi>Low-Wines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron, pro Quer':</hi> The Ercise is setled by 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. By which Act a Special Court of Iudicature is appointed, for the more speedy recovery of the Duty only; but not to leave all parties concern'd to the arbitrary Power of the <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and to deliver all up to their Will and Pleasure. And the Conusance belongs to them only in the first place; but secondarily to the <hi>Common Law:</hi> The <hi>Commissioners</hi> must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the truth of the Matter, but can stay no Procéed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: Nor do the Procéedings before the <hi>Commissioners</hi> privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any persons from being subject to Actions; but the end and design of them is only to prevent more tedious Procéed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And if they excéed their own Iurisdiction, that does not take away from the Iurisdiction of this <hi>Court.</hi> And though the Act gives a Recovery before the <hi>Commissioners;</hi> yet does it not subject all parties to their Power solely. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Matter here is not within their Iurisdiction, which is a stinted, limited Iurisdiction; and that implies a Negative, <hi>viz.</hi> that they shall not procéed at all in other cases. But if they should commit a Mistake in a thing that were within their power, that would not be Examinable here. And it is to be considered, that Special Iurisdictions may be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed; 1. With respect to <hi>Place;</hi> as a <hi>Leet</hi> or a <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi> 2. With respect to <hi>Persons;</hi> as in 10 <hi>Rep. the Case of the Marshalshea:</hi> 3. With respect to the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> of their Iurisdiction; and here the <hi>Statute</hi> limits their Iurisdiction in all these Three respects: And therefore if they give Iudgment in a Cause arising in another place, or betwixt Private persons, or in other matters, all is void, and <hi>Coram non Judice;</hi> as if they should adjudge <hi>Rose-water</hi> to be <hi>Strong-water.</hi> And here <hi>Low-Wines</hi> are Waters of the first Extraction.</p>
               <pb n="484" facs="tcp:52142:215"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> These Acts must not be extended further than they ought: For by that means the <hi>King</hi> might come to lose all his Duty upon Importation of such Liquors. And this would be in effect, to make a New <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If such <hi>Commissioners</hi> excéed their Authority, what they do is <hi>Coram non Judice;</hi> and then, as appears 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> there Officers are not priviledged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Though the Information before them supposes the matter to be within their Power and Iurisdiction; yet the party is not thereby concluded, but that he may aver the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; as in the case of a Presentment in a <hi>Court Leet,</hi> if the Fact arose out of the Iurisdiction of the <hi>Leet,</hi> or was a private Nusance, or a Matter in difference betwixt Private persons; as in 10 <hi>Rep. the Case of the Marshalsea.</hi> So where a Parish-Tax is laid on a place, that is not within the Parish; <hi>Vide</hi> 5 <hi>Rep. St. John's Case,</hi> of a <hi>Hand-Gun,</hi> if it be not within the <hi>Statute of</hi> 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. the party is not excused in <hi>Trespass,</hi> by a Warrant from a Iustice of Peace.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Chief Baron</hi> held, against the Opinion of <hi>Baron Rainesford,</hi> that it would have béen against the Defendants, though they had pleaded Specially: But otherwise in the case of a <hi>Brewer</hi> or <hi>Retailer,</hi> who are expresly compriz'd in the Act; as if they should adjudge <hi>Small Beer</hi> to be <hi>Strong,</hi> for they have a Iurisdiction there, and an <hi>Appeal</hi> lies from their Sentence. But where they have no Power over the thing, as here they have not, the case is altered; and concluded <hi>pro Quer</hi> and Iudgment was given accordingly.</p>

            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> He said, the <hi>Declaration</hi> was naught, because the Plaintiff declar'd, that <hi>per Consuetudinem Angliae, &amp;c.</hi> which he said was naught, because the Custom of <hi>England</hi> is the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and what the Iudges are bound to take notice of; and that therefore the <hi>Consuetudo Angliae</hi> ought to have been omitted, and that it would have been naught upon a <hi>General Demurrer,</hi> 34 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Bro.

So in case of a Particular Custom, as in 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 24. a Custom of a Mannor to collect Rents, and receive <hi>Twenty shillings</hi> for the same, <hi>Debt</hi> lies for it; yet there is no Privity of Contract. So he pray'd Iudgment <hi>pro Quer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chief Baron:</hi> This is a Case of Weight and Concern for the future, and deserves Consideration. Declarations upon <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> have often varied: Sometimes <hi>Declarations</hi> have béen upon a Custom amongst <hi>Merchants</hi> only, without laying an express Promise: Afterwards they came to declare upon an <hi>Assumpsit.</hi> And after all, if an <hi>Action of Debt</hi> will lye, it will be a short Cut, and pare off a long Recital. For if <hi>Debt</hi> lies, a man may Declare upon a Bill of Exchange <hi>accepted</hi> in <hi>Debt,</hi> or in an <hi>Indebitatus Assumpsit,</hi> for so much Mony. But for the Plaintiff's inserting the Custom of the Realm into his Declaration here, I hold that to be meer super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity and redundancy, which does not vitiate the <hi>Declaration.</hi> And without doubt, if the Common Law, or the Custom of a Place create a Duty, <hi>Debt</hi> lies for it, without more ado; as in the case of a <hi>Toll</hi> due by <hi>Custom;</hi> 20 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.1. and so in cases of a certain Sum due by Custom for <hi>Pound-breach</hi> to the Lord of a Mannor, or to a Goaler for <hi>Barr-Fees, Vide</hi> 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. But the great Question here is, whether or no a <hi>Debt</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> be hereby raised: For if it be no more than a <hi>Collateral Engagement, Order</hi> or <hi>Promise, Debt</hi> lies not; as in the case that has béen cited, of Goods delivered by <hi>A</hi> to <hi>B,</hi> at the request of <hi>C,</hi> which <hi>C</hi> promiseth to pay for, if the other does not; for in that case a <hi>Debt</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> does not arise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>A</hi> and <hi>C,</hi> but a Collateral Obligation only. In our Case the <hi>Acceptance</hi> of the Bill amounts clearly to a Promise, to pay the Mony; but it may be a question, whether it amounts to a <hi>Debt</hi> or not? For if so, then it is assignable to the <hi>King,</hi> or by <hi>Commissioners of Bankrupts.</hi> And it were worth while to enquire, what the course has béen amongst <hi>Merchants;</hi> or to direct an Issue for tryal of the Custom amongst Merchants in this case. For although we must take notice in General of the <hi>Law of Merchants;</hi> yet all their Customs we cannot know but by Information. And although the Verdict here finds it in effect, and so might seem to inform us; yet it does not appear
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:52142:216"/> that the Custom was in Issue: So that we can have no certain Information of the Custom by this Verdict. <hi>Et Adjor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur.</hi>

            <p>Presidents were ordered to be search'd; and afterwards in <hi>Hillary Term,</hi> 20 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. it was moved again, and Presidents shewn, that by the Opinion of Chief Iustice <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <hi>Debt</hi> lay not; and all the Clerks in <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> certified, that they had no <hi>President</hi> in <hi>London</hi> of <hi>Debt</hi> in such case.</p>
            <p>Afterwards in <hi>Hillary Term,</hi> 20 <hi>&amp;</hi> 21 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. the Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their Opinions, that an <hi>Action of Debt</hi> would not lye upon a <hi>Bill of Exchange accepted,</hi> against the <hi>Accepter:</hi> But that a Special <hi>Action upon the Case</hi> must be brought against him. For that the <hi>acceptance</hi> does not create a <hi>Duty,</hi> no more than a Promise made by a Stranger, to pay, &amp;c. if the Creditor will forbear his Debt. And he that drew the Bill continues <hi>Debtor,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>acceptance;</hi> which makes the <hi>Accepter</hi> liable to pay it. And this course of <hi>accepting Bills</hi> being a general Custom amon st all Traders both within and without the Realm, and having every where that effect, as to make the <hi>Accepter</hi> subject to pay the Contents, the Court must take notice of that Custom; but the Custom does not extend so far as to Create a <hi>Debt;</hi> only makes the Accepter <hi>Onera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis</hi> to pay the Mony. Though Custom may give an <hi>Action of Debt,</hi> as in 20 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>of Toll;</hi> and so in case of a Fine for a Copyhold.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, and because <hi>no President</hi> could be produced, that an <hi>Action of Debt</hi> had béen brought upon an <hi>Accepted Bill of Exchange,</hi> Iudgment was arrested.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Ralph Freeman</hi> purchased Land for the term of 99 years, in his own Name; and afterwards purchased the Inheritance of the same Lands in <hi>Trust:</hi> And then by his <hi>Will</hi> disposed of these Lands, to the Sons of <hi>Sir George Sands,</hi> his Grand-Children born, or which should be born in his life-time, and directed Conveyances to be made accordingly by his <hi>Trustees,</hi> and died. At that time <hi>Sir George Sands</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Freeman</hi> and <hi>George;</hi> and <hi>Freeman</hi> died, and after the death of <hi>Sir Ralph, Sir George</hi> had another Son <hi>Freeman,</hi> who kill'd his Brother <hi>George;</hi> for which he was attainted and executed, and no Conveyances were made by the <hi>Trustees,</hi> pursuant to <hi>Sir Ralph Freeman</hi>'s <hi>Will:</hi> And the Questions hereupon were two;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Whether, as this case is, the term for years was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether or no the Inheritance in Trust were forfeited?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Winnington pro Querente:</hi> A <hi>Trust</hi> is defined in 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 121. to be an Interest annex'd in <hi>Privity</hi> to an Estate in Lands; and the <hi>Common Law</hi> takes notice of it, <hi>Lit. Sect.</hi> 464. <hi>Cestuy que Trust</hi> shall be impanell'd on a Iury, <hi>Vide Co. Lit.</hi> 272. <hi>b.</hi> 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 7. There shall be a <hi>Possessio fratris</hi> of a Trust, and it was transferrable before 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and the second Feoffée should be seiz'd to the former use, <hi>Vide</hi> 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 2, 3. it will pass by Grant. And there is a Diversity betwixt a <hi>Privity in Estate,</hi> and a <hi>Personal Privity;</hi> the latter will not go to the <hi>King,</hi> but the former will: For authority, <hi>Vide Co.</hi> 12 <hi>Rep.</hi> 1, 2. a Case cited Collaterally; which is contrary to <hi>Cro. Jac.</hi> 512, 514. where it is held, that a <hi>Trust of a Term</hi> is forfeitable, but not a <hi>Trust of
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:52142:217"/> an Inheritance, Anders.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 294. An <hi>use</hi> not forfeited for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, unless it be of a Chattel. The Term in this case of ours is forfeited; for this is not a Term that attends the Inheritance; but it is a substantive Estate of it self, not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon or ancillary to the Inheritance; for they are severally directed by the party, and <hi>Sir Ralph</hi> had the Term a long time before he purchased the Inheritance. <hi>Vide</hi> 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 6. 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 56.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ellis pro Defendente. First,</hi> The <hi>Trust of an Inheritance</hi> is not forfeited by Felony: <hi>First,</hi> Because to <hi>a forfeiture</hi> for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony and to an <hi>Escheat</hi> a <hi>Tenure</hi> is requisite. <hi>Vide</hi> 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> 21. and for that reason a Fair or a Market are not forfeited; and a <hi>Trust</hi> is not held of any; but the Lands in <hi>Trust. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> If the Law were otherwise, there would be a double for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of the same thing; <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Trustee,</hi> and by the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuy que Trust,</hi> which is unreasonable, and cannot be. <hi>Vide</hi> 14 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>Thirdly, Cestuy que Trust</hi> has neither <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> nor <hi>in re,</hi> but remedy in <hi>equity</hi> only, 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 5. 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 7. 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 2. 3. which does not extend to a <hi>Paroll Trust</hi> of Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments. <hi>Vid Bulst.</hi> 2. <hi>part</hi> 830. 21 <hi>Car. B. R. the King versus Holland;</hi> a Trust for an <hi>Alien</hi> in Fée not forfeited to the <hi>King,</hi> 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 513. nor for <hi>Felony;</hi> but it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able over by Common use in Equity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second Point,</hi> If a Trust of a Term attend the Inheritance, then it is of the same nature with the Inheritance; but if it do not attend the Inheritance, but be a substantive Estate of self, it is not forfeited: Because it belongs not then to the Felon, nor was ever in him, but it goes to the Administrator of the Termor, which the Defendant in this case is; and the Felon had no Interest in this Term by the Devise, because he was not then Born. And concluded <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> The sole Question is here, whether the Lease attend the Inheritance in such manner, as that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance cannot be forfeited without it; for if it do not so attend it, then does it not appeartain to the Felon, but to the Administrator of him that was Slain, or to the Trustée in possession; and then this Point as to the Term will be out of doors. But if it do attend the Inheritance, the Question will be, to what purpose it does attend it: For to some purpose it does not, as to prevent Dower, or to Stave off a Debt, for such a Term shall be Assets, if it attend an Inheritance in Fée-simple; but not if it attend an Estate Tail; which is not subject to the payment of Debts in equity.</p>
               <pb n="490" facs="tcp:52142:218"/>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Hill. Term</hi> 20 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Regis, Serjeant Maynard</hi> argued <hi>pro Quer.</hi> that both the Inheritance and the Lease were forfeited.</p>
               <p>There are two Reasons, why Estates are forfeited for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony; one for Example, the other for the encrease of the <hi>King's</hi> Revenue, in order to the Publique safety. And I conceive that although the Lease do not wait upon the Inheritance, yet it is forfeited in this case, because the Defendant <hi>Sir George Sands,</hi> who hath the Lease as Administrator, has it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the Inheritance, that was conveyed to him before, and the Lease being in him <hi>in auter droit,</hi> it does not drown in the Inheritance; for if it did, it would not be <hi>Assets,</hi> but might work a <hi>Devastavit,</hi> which the Law will not work by any Operation; for it will not work a wrong; so that the Term is not extinguish't. And it is agréed on both sides, that both the Lease and the Inheritance were in the Defendant in Trust for his Son <hi>George.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Secondly,</hi> by <hi>George</hi> his Death they are in the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in Trust for his Son <hi>Freeman</hi> the Felon; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the méeting of these two Trusts, of a Term and of the Inheritance, the one does not drown the other.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Thirdly,</hi> a Lease for years in Trust is forfeitable for Felony, for the <hi>King's</hi> Interest, and by his Prerogative; and so it was held <hi>Pasch.</hi> 7. <hi>Jacob. in Sir Walter Raleigh's Case in Scacc.</hi> that a Trust of a Term is forfeited, and so it was Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Trin.</hi> 11 <hi>Jac. in Abington's Case:</hi> But the case of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in Trust is not resolved. And in 2 <hi>Car.</hi> 512. it is held that a Term in Trust is forfeited, but not a Fée in Trust. <hi>Hill.</hi> 3 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Scacc. Babington's Case;</hi> held that if the <hi>King's</hi> Receiver Purchase a Lease in Trust, it is lyable to the <hi>King's</hi> Debts, though it were afterwards aliened. And in <hi>Pasch.</hi> 12 <hi>Car. C.B. in Sir Anthony Anger's Case,</hi> it is held, that a Lease for years of an Advowson in Trust, is forfeited by the Outlawry of <hi>Cestuy que Trust;</hi> but it is held there likewise, that the King cannot have a <hi>Qu. Imp.</hi> or an <hi>Ejectment,</hi> but a <hi>Subpoena</hi> only.</p>
               <p>And great regard ought to be had to the <hi>King's</hi> Revenues in this case, because of the consequence of it: And a Trust does not hinder a man from granting over the Term; as is séen in dayly practice. If one Obligée commit Felony, the whole Obligation is forfeited. And it was resolved in <hi>Hill.</hi> 30 <hi>Eliz. B. R.</hi> that matter of <hi>Account</hi> is forfeitable to the <hi>King</hi> by Outlawry, tho' not transferrable by Grant, as a Trust of a Term is.</p>
               <pb n="491" facs="tcp:52142:218"/>
               <p>And if it be so, that the Trust of a Term is forfeitable, then the Question will arise betwixt the <hi>Felon</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> whether of the two shall be preferred: And it is clear, that the <hi>Felon</hi> cannot have a Trust against the <hi>King,</hi> and the Trustée can have no colour to withold it from both the <hi>Felon</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> may Pardon and restore it to the <hi>Felon,</hi> by which means the Trustée would lose the benefit of it. And certainly in all reason, the <hi>King</hi> ought to be preferred before the <hi>Felon;</hi> for otherwise, the Punishment of Felony and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the <hi>King's</hi> Revenue would be both avoided.</p>
               <p>Also a Trust is a Right in Conscience to take the profits, and ensues the nature of the Land; for by the 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. there shall be a <hi>possessio fratris</hi> of an Vse. And by <hi>Co. Lit. Cestuy que use</hi> may take a Release as Tenant at Will; and Trusts are look't upon by Acts of Parliament as Lands; <hi>Vide the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Mortmain, Frauds, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, they were look't upon as créeping up to the destruction of the Common Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Statutes of Bankrupts,</hi> enable the Commissioners to dispose of them. And although a Trust in Fée be not forfeited to the <hi>King,</hi> by way of Escheat, as is held 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 513. the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that is because the <hi>King</hi> has a Tenant in by Title; and if it were otherwise in that case, the Lord would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced; but there can be in this case no prejudice to any third person, for the Lands here are held of the <hi>King:</hi> In 31 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>Rot.</hi> 30. <hi>in Scacc.</hi> in the <hi>Treasurer's Remembrance;</hi> if a <hi>Baron</hi> purchase Lands in Fée Ioyntly with his <hi>Feme,</hi> yet they shall be lyable to the <hi>King's</hi> Debt, after the Husband's Death, if his Wife Survive him. And it was held in 22 <hi>Jac. in Cur' Wardor'</hi> that a <hi>Power of Revocation</hi> in the party is subject to the <hi>King's</hi> Debt. And since we are here in a Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, it is not conscionable for <hi>Sir George Sands</hi> to kéep it to himself; and less conscionable for him to withold the Fée-simple from the <hi>King.</hi> And no <hi>Assent</hi> of the Administrator to hold the Term in Trust for the <hi>Felon,</hi> will debar the <hi>King</hi> of it; because it is Assets to Debts. <hi>Vide</hi> 40 <hi>Ass.</hi> 35. that the <hi>Assent</hi> of an Executor is not necessary, in case of a <hi>Legacy</hi> given to the <hi>King.</hi> And concluded <hi>pro Quer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Robert Atkyns</hi> argued <hi>pro Defendente,</hi> that neither the Trust of the Inheritance nor of the Lease was forfeited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> A Trust is altogether the same that an Vse was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and they have the same <hi>Parents, Fraud and Fear;</hi> and the same <hi>Nurse, a Court of Conscience.</hi> By Statute Law an <hi>Use, Trust</hi> or <hi>Confidence,</hi> are all one and the same thing. What an <hi>Use</hi> is, <hi>Vide Pl. Com.</hi> 352. <hi>and</hi> 1 <hi>Rep. in Chudley's Case;</hi> and they are collateral to the Land: A <hi>Cesty
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:52142:219"/> que Trust</hi> has neither <hi>Jus ad rem</hi> nor <hi>in re.</hi> Now for the <hi>first Point,</hi> a Trust in Fée-simple is not forfeited, for these Reasons; <hi>First,</hi> It is not an Interest at Common Law; and therefore not forfeitable. And it was one of the chief causes, why <hi>Uses</hi> were Invented; <hi>viz.</hi> to prevent forfeitures, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in <hi>Hob. Rep. Seignior Sheffield's Case.</hi> And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, they do not differ from Common or Rent; which are not forfeitable: And 1 <hi>Rep. Chudleigh's Case,</hi> they are neither Chattells nor Inheritances, but Amphibious sorts of things, and of an Vnnatural Generation; and the Common Law has no regard to them. <hi>Vid. Dr. and Stud.</hi> 98 <hi>Lane's Rep.</hi> 104. <hi>Perk.</hi> 69, 89. No Dower, nor Tenancy by the Curtesie of an Vse. An Action of Trespass lies against a <hi>Cestuy que Use; Pl.

Nor do Acts of Parliament take notice of them, so as to Countenance them, but to suppress them 1 <hi>Inst.</hi> 71. and to support the Rules of Law; <hi>Dyer</hi> 10. <hi>Pl. Com.</hi> 58. <hi>Dyer</hi> 134, 163. they are barred by Fines, run along with the Land, and there shall be <hi>Possessio fratris</hi> of them. 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 136. <hi>b.</hi> They were not at the Common Law, but were lately found out, <hi>Vide Hobart's Rep.</hi> 338.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First Objection, Uses</hi> are Countenanced by the Law; for <hi>Lit. Cestuy que use</hi> shall be impannelled on a Iury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The reason of that depends upon the Statute of 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3. A Trust does not lie in Tenure, and therefore is not forfeitable. 3 <hi>Inst.</hi> 21. 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>of Treasons</hi> does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>Uses.</hi> 3 <hi>Inst.</hi> 19. And it would be unreasonable to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the same Lands to double forfeitures; <hi>viz.</hi> by the Owner of the Land and by the <hi>Cestuy que Trust. Vide Lane's Rep.</hi> 42.</p>
               <p>Besides, a man's Interest in an <hi>Use,</hi> is in the Nature of a right of Action, which is not transferrable: 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 48. 52. 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 2, 3. No remedy for it but in Equity; and if the case in 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> had not béen settled, it would be hard to maintain it for Law; and so it has béen held by good Opinions. And the Lord by Escheat, is to hold the Lands discharged of the Trust, and by the same reason shall not have the forfeiture of it. <hi>Vide Mo. Rep.</hi> 196. <hi>Princip. Pasch.</hi> 8 <hi>Jac.</hi> For Authorities, <hi>Vide</hi> 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 2, 3. 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 512, 513. 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Bro. Feoffment all Uses.</hi> A Feoffée shall hold Lands discharged of them; and the Lord of a Villein was not to have them till 19 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 15. 1 <hi>Inst.</hi> 19. 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and other Acts, which give the forfeiture of Vses in particular cases, shew that they were not forfeitable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <pb n="493" facs="tcp:52142:219"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second Point.</hi> The Trust of a Term which waits upon the Inheritance, is not forfeitable neither, and this Point has two parts: <hi>First,</hi> Whether the Trust of a Term waiting, can be forfeited. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether this Term here do so wait, as not to be forfeited but to stick to and follow the Inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? In this case, the Term for years was Originally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>Alderman Freeman's</hi> Name, and the Inheritance after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards purchased in the Defendant's Name. And then both are given by Will to the Defendant's Sons: Whereby <hi>George</hi> the Son had the possession of the Term by the Devise, and the Inheritance waits upon it. And the Devise here is only a Declaration, that the Devisees should have the Lands by Conveyance from the Trustées, and not before; so that before such Conveyance, they have but as it were a Right of Action, and but an Equitable Right, and it is not properly a Trust of a Term but a Declaration, to whom the Conveyance shall be made: And therefore, the Estate continues in the Offender, and it is not for a Court of Equity to dislodge it, and make it wait upon the Inheritance, altho' the Devisor might intend it. For that is but a puisne practice, and it tends to the subversion of the Rules of Law, to turn a term for years into an Inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, tho' neither an Estate in Dower, nor a Tenancy by the curtesie can be had out of it. And such settlements of Terms, have always béen Discountenanced by the Iudges; 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 230. <hi>Mo. Rep.</hi> 810. 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 52. <hi>and</hi> 15 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> held that <hi>Lampet's</hi> Case deserved to be qustioned, if it were not settled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second Point,</hi> A Trust for years is not forfeited; <hi>First,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Cestuy que Trust</hi> had no legal Interest. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He had no legal remedy to gain possession. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Lord by <hi>Escheat</hi> would hold the Lands discharged of it, and therefore in this case, the Trustée for years shall have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it. And 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 512. does not warrant the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in case of a forfeiture for Felony; for there was not in that case any Lease from the King, but a personal contract, which is not devisable, as the Interest of the Term was here. And the <hi>Lord Cook</hi> in his 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> takes a difference betwixt Choses in Action or personal, and Frauds apparent; where there is a <hi>fraud apparent,</hi> their will be a Forfeiture; but there is none in this case: There was no Fraud in the Creation of this Lease; the intention of separating it was, to be a security to the Inheritance. And <hi>Armstrong's</hi> Case there cited, is not like to this case; for in the case of a Bond, the party has a legal Interest to Forfeit; and Fraud intended upon the <hi>Statute of</hi> 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 4. is the ground of the Forfeiture of the Lease.
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:52142:220"/> But no such Fraud appears here. <hi>Vid. Lane's Rep.</hi> 104. 42. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. <hi>Jac. Lib. Decretor' in Scaccario</hi> 146. <hi>and Sir Walt. Raleigh's Case,</hi> there Fraud was the reason and ground of the Iudgment. If a Lease be Assigned in Trust, and then the Inheritance be purchased, and the Purchaser be Attainted of Treason, the <hi>King</hi> shall hold the Estate discharged of the Lease, because here is <hi>Fraud and Covin.</hi> And in <hi>Chudleigh's Case,</hi> 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> A Trust in Fée-simple is to many purposes Regarded as a <hi>Chattel;</hi> so that this being here the <hi>Trust</hi> but of a <hi>Chattel,</hi> will not enforce the Forfeiture. <hi>Vide Dyer</hi> 143. And if the Lease in our case wait upon the Inheritance, then it is for the Defendant; and it will wait upon him as well as upon the Offender, if he have the Inheritance. And Iudgments in Equity ought not to contradict the Rules of Law, or delight to make Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Lane's Rep.</hi> 54. a Trust of a Term, which a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band has in right of his Wife is not Forfeited for the Felony of the Husband; which does not contradict <hi>Abington's Case,</hi> for there was a <hi>fraud,</hi> and so there was in <hi>Chirton's Case, Dyer,</hi> and so he concluded <hi>pro Defendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron,</hi> There is no question concerning the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of the <hi>Fee-simple</hi> in <hi>Trust;</hi> for that must arise by <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat,</hi> and there can be no Escheat but <hi>pro defectu Tenentis.</hi> But here is a Tenant <hi>in esse:</hi> If the offence committed had béen <hi>Treason,</hi> then there might have béen a Question, whether the Inheritance in this case should be Forfeited, in regard the Rent and Tenure have a continuance. But whether <hi>Sir George Sands</hi> shall hold the Land discharged of the Lease, or that the <hi>King</hi> shall have the Term is the sole doubt. The <hi>King</hi> does not gain an <hi>Interst</hi> in a <hi>Trust</hi> by Forfeiture, as he does in <hi>Debt;</hi> for there the Interest of the Bond passes to the <hi>King,</hi> and Process lies to recover it in the <hi>King's</hi> own name. And it is questionable, whether the <hi>King</hi> can have this in point of <hi>Prerogative</hi> in case of <hi>Felony,</hi> tho' perhaps more might be said if the Offence had béen <hi>Treason.</hi> It is the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Party, that Creates and Governs Vses and Trusts: And therefore a Lease shall be deemed to attend the Inheritance, if it appears that the parties intended that it should do so; as here it does. And then it is no more than a shadow, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory to it; for otherwise, it would not be attendant of it. And then it cannot in this case go to the <hi>Felon;</hi> but to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrator of <hi>George</hi> the Son. And here they are consolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Intention of the Will, which directs that the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees shall make Conveyances accordingly; nor is it kept on Foot, but only to avoid <hi>mesne</hi> incumbrances, which might
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:52142:220"/> affect the Inheritance. And this appears to have béen the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the parties, when the fée was purchased; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lease ought to go with the fée. And in the cases of Leases for years in <hi>Trust,</hi> that have béen Forfeited, <hi>Fraud</hi> was the ground of it in the cases that have béen cited. <hi>Et Adjurnatur.</hi>

               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Easter Term Anno</hi> 21 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. The <hi>Barons</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered their Opinions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baron Turner pro Defendente,</hi> That here is no Forfeiture, neither of the Inheritance, nor of the Term. That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in Trust was not Forfeited, he quoted <hi>Co.</hi> 3. <hi>Rep. the Marquess of Winchester's Case, Co.</hi> 12. <hi>Rep.</hi> 1, 2. 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Cro. Jac.</hi> 513. <hi>and the Statute of</hi> 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 20. concerning Forfeitures for <hi>Treason</hi> admits it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Lease was not Forfeited, he argued from it's being attendant upon the Inheritance, and quoted, <hi>Co. Plea. Cor.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> There are two main Points in the case. <hi>First,</hi> Whether the <hi>Inheritance</hi> be Forfeited? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Term for years</hi> be? And I hold that neither is Forfeited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Trust</hi> of the <hi>Inheritance</hi> is not Forfeitable in this case, because if it were, the <hi>King</hi> must be in by <hi>Escheat;</hi> which cannot be but for want of a Tenant; and here the Feoffées are Tenants. And at this day a <hi>Trust</hi> in <hi>Fee,</hi> or in <hi>Tail</hi> is not Forfeited at Common Law; but by the Statutes of 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>and</hi> 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 20. for <hi>Treason,</hi> as appears by the words of the Acts. And herewith agrées <hi>Co.</hi> 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of Winchester's Case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I hold that such a Trust in an <hi>Alien</hi> is Forfeita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. and will belong to the <hi>King;</hi> as it was held in <hi>Tr.</hi> 23. <hi>Car.</hi> in <hi>Holland's Case,</hi> and the reason is because an <hi>Alien</hi> has no capacity to Purchase, for the benefit of any other, but of the <hi>King.</hi> And it would otherwise be inconvenient, that Aliens should receive the profits of Lands to their own use; and the mischief would be the same, as if <hi>Aliens</hi> purchased the Lands themselves; but in that case the <hi>King</hi> is entituled to the profits only, the Land it self is not Forfeited to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I agrée that in case of the <hi>King's Debtor,</hi> Lands in <hi>Trust</hi> for him in Fée-simple are lyable to the <hi>King's Debt</hi> by the Common Law, <hi>per Cursum Scaccarii,</hi> which makes the Law in such cases; and this appears by Presidents <hi>Temp. Hen.</hi> 6. and before 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. a Trust or Vse was lyable to a Statute; and that is the reason of <hi>Chirton's Case, in</hi> 50 <hi>Ass.</hi> And it was held in <hi>Sir Ed. Cook's Case, in Cur.
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:52142:221"/> Wardor'</hi> that if the <hi>King's</hi> Debtor have a power of Revocation, that makes them lyable to the <hi>King's</hi> Debt: And that was the reason of <hi>Babington's Case, in Cur. Wardor'</hi> in 30 <hi>Car.</hi> and of <hi>Hoad's Case,</hi> in <hi>Pasch.</hi> 4 <hi>Jac.</hi> where Lands in Trust for a Recusant were subjected to the Debt of 20 <hi>l. per mensem;</hi> so in 41 <hi>Eliz. Babington's Case,</hi> a Trust lyable to a Debt imprest, because <hi>Cestuy que Trust</hi> has a profit by it, but that is a Special case, and grounded upon a Special Course in the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> But the Forfeiture of an Inheritance for Felony depends upon another reason, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the want of a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, which does not hold in this case: And in the <hi>Statute of Hen.</hi> 8. of <hi>Uses</hi> this reason of Law appears. as also in the <hi>Statute of</hi> 17 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. of a Purchase by a <hi>Villain</hi> in <hi>Trust,</hi> because the Lord has a Tenant to answer him his Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If this Trust be not Forfeited to the <hi>King,</hi> who shall have it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The Feoffée <hi>Sir George Sands</hi> shall now hold the Lands discharged of it, as in case of the Grantée of a Rent in Fée-simple, who dies without Heirs, the Tenant of the Land shall hold it discharged of the Rent, because there is no other that has any Title to it; and so he concluded that Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Second</hi> matter is, whether the term for years be here Forfeited? And I deny that it is. There is a diversity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rm Assigned and a Term originally created: If a Term be Assigned in Trust with Fraud, it is Forfeited by the <hi>Outlawry</hi> of <hi>Cestuy que Trust,</hi> because it is only a Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel and so estéemed; wherewith agrées <hi>Cro. Jac.</hi> 513. and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington's Case</hi> before cited; <hi>and Sir Walt. Raleigh's Case;</hi> and such a <hi>Trust</hi> shall go with the Inheritance and is governed by it, as <hi>Mo. Rep. Lord Molineux's Case;</hi> where it was held that it should go to the Heirs of a Man's Body; and so in some cases, a Term for years shall go along with an Inheritance <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> As if a <hi>Feme Covert</hi> has a <hi>Trust</hi> for years, her Husband cannot dispose of it, as he may of a Term not in <hi>Trust. Vide Co. Lit. Chap. Remitter.</hi> And in many cases Trusts are ruled by other Rules of <hi>Equity</hi> than Lands are, as in case of a Trust in Fée, a Court of Equity does not make it <hi>Assets</hi> to an <hi>Heir,</hi> as it does a Trust for years in the Hands of an <hi>Executor;</hi> so that the course of Equity go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns them. A Trust for years cannot be limitted in Tail with remainders over, no more than a Term for years can. A <hi>Trust</hi> of a Term that follows the Inheritance may be resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to a Box of <hi>Charters,</hi> which shall go to the Heir with the Land, that they concern 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 10. but if the Owner Grant
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:52142:221"/> them over, then they shall go to the Executors of the Grantée; for by the Grant they become severed from the Inheritance, and become Chattels in gross, 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 3. So here, if the Lease had béen assign'd over and severed, it would have been forfeited; but so long as it is attendant upon the Fee, it is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitable. Nor was there any Conveyance or Appointment in this case to make it a Lease in gross. And therefore it cannot be forfeited for these Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because the Estate in Law of the term was not in the person Attainted, but in the Lessée; and if it were liable to be forfeited, it must be forfeited as being a Chattel in him; for if not a Chattel in him, it is not forfeitable by him. And this term could not by any means come to the person attainted, for he was not the person for whom it was designed, but to his Brother <hi>George,</hi> and then it must go as a Chattel to his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor or Administrator, who is <hi>Sir George</hi> the Defendant. And if it were not a Chattel in <hi>George,</hi> it cannot be so in <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> but must attend upon the Inheritance: So <hi>quâcunque viâ datâ.</hi> the term here is not forfeited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> My 2d Reason is grounded upon the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Director and Devisor, that it should attend the Inheritance and be convey'd over accordingly, that it might not be kept asunder. And the Devisor directed, that both Estates should be convey'd over to <hi>Freeman</hi> and <hi>George Sands,</hi> deceased: But <hi>George</hi> had a power to dispose thereof, which he has not done. But if it had been limited to the <hi>first, second</hi> and <hi>third Sons</hi> of <hi>George</hi> in tall, then <hi>George</hi> would not have had a power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of it, because then it would have depended upon the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. But as this case was, <hi>George</hi> might by his act have disposed thereof as <hi>Heir,</hi> the Lease being an attendant upon the Inheritance, but it would not be forfeited, <hi>Causa qua supra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Person attainted is not the <hi>first Person</hi> to whom it was limited; but he came to it as Heir, and by consequence takes it as part of the Inheritance, and he has no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in it; As when a Mortgage for years is assign'd over in Trust to attend upon the Inheritance, purchased by the Mortgagée. And if it were otherwise, many Inconveniences would ensue in cases of Marriage-Settlements, and other Settlements of Estates, in which it is the common course to preserve such a term, and not to let it drown in the Inheritance. For if the term were but forfeited in such a case, it would frustrate the whole design of the Settlement. <hi>Sir Walter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh's Case</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> was to this effect; <hi>viz. Queen Elizabeth</hi> purchased a Lease for years, and gave it to <hi>Sir Walter
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:52142:222"/> Rawleigh,</hi> and afterwards she purchased the Fée, and intended to give it to <hi>Sir Walter</hi> likewise; who to prevent a <hi>Merger,</hi> assign'd over the term to his Son, then a Child of six years of age: Afterwards the <hi>Queen</hi> convey'd the Fée to <hi>Sir Walter,</hi> who setled it upon his Son; but the Conveyance was void in Law. Afterwards, in <hi>primo Jac. Sir Walter</hi> was attainted of Treason, and then granted over all his Goods and Chattels in Trust for himself; and then made a Lease of his Lands for 99 <hi>Years,</hi> if he should so long live, in Trust for himself. And it was adjudged, that the Lease <hi>suprà</hi> was forfeited, though assign'd to his Son, because there was Fraud apparent, and himself took the Profits and had surrendred and taken a new Lease of the Bishop of whom it was held; and that the <hi>King</hi>'s Inheritance was discharged of it, or at least that it should be attendant on the Inheritance that was forfeited. So he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>pro Defendente;</hi> and Iudgment was afterwards given, <hi>quod Defendens eat inde sine die.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He said, the <hi>Queen</hi> was deceived in her Grant, and therefore the <hi>Patent</hi> void; because she did not recite all the Leases that were in being. But to this it was said and held <hi>per Curiam,</hi> That no Leases in being need to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> In regard of the Consideration; which was the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice performed by <hi>Jones</hi> in his life-time, and the Maintenance of his Wife and Children; for if the other Exposition were admitted, it would not be effectual for the benefit of the Grantée.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Intention of the <hi>Queen</hi> and of the Party was so; and the <hi>Queens</hi> Charity implies as much, who designed to confer a Boon upon the <hi>Patentee.</hi>

                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron:</hi> There is no question but the last Lease is good in its Creation, and it may take effect in Reversion, or by surrender of the other Leases; and if it had béen for <hi>One hundred years,</hi> it would have been good for so many of them as remained unexpired at the determination of the other Leases: But when it shall commence, depends upon the Exposition of the Letters Patents: If it be intended to be a Lease in Reversion, all is well. But if the <hi>King</hi> intended to grant a Lease in possession, then the Grant is void, though there be a

                  <hi>Holt pro Defendente. First,</hi> A <hi>Quo minùs</hi> is not a Writ or Bill of Priviledge, nor is it so called; as when Priviledged persons Sue in the Courts where they are Priviledged. <hi>Vide Dyer</hi> 328. 3 <hi>Leon.</hi> 223. But if the Plaintiff were an Account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and entred upon his Account, that would alter the case, because his attendance would then be requisite, <hi>de die in diem.</hi> But a <hi>Quo minus</hi> is now but a common Action here. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by 38 <hi>Ass. Pl.</hi> 20. that a <hi>Quo minus</hi> did not lye unless a Debt were confess't to the <hi>King,</hi> and then the King's Debtor had a <hi>Quo minus</hi> for the <hi>King's</hi> benefit. So it appears by 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.6. that a man in <hi>Custodiâ Marischalli</hi> had the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Court of <hi>King's Bench,</hi> if he were sued <hi>alibi,</hi> and might have a <hi>Supersedeas.</hi> which he cannot have now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is now common practise, and tho' <hi>Custod.

Nor is there any prejudice to the <hi>King,</hi> for he may have Execution elsewhere: As appears, 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> 115. And here the <hi>King</hi> has granted over the <hi>Conusance,</hi> whereby he has depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself of any benefit thereby. <hi>Vide</hi> 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.33. 22 <hi>Ass.</hi> 83. <hi>Bro. Conusance</hi> 25. And the words here <hi>licet tangat nos</hi> are a bar to the <hi>King:</hi> As in <hi>Moor's Rep.</hi> 126. <hi>Reg.</hi> 187. And the <hi>King's</hi> Interest being here named expressly, the Patent ought to be held as strong against him, as the Law would be for him if he had not béen named.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chief Baron.</hi> There are three questions in this case. <hi>First.</hi> Whether the Grant extends to this Court, or not? <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Whether it extend to this Action? And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Conusance</hi> ought to be allawed here, the Action being laid in <hi>London?</hi> As for the Case of <hi>Wilkins,</hi> that has béen ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is no President; for it was declared, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusance there was not allowed, both because of the Lachess of the Defendant, and upon a particular reason of Copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nership. Three sorts of Persons are Priviledged in this Court, <hi>Debtors, Officers</hi> and <hi>Accountants</hi> entred upon their Accounts. The two latter shall have their Priviledge, if they be sued elsewhere, but not the first: His Priviledge will not prevent Conusance, if the Grant extend to this Court. For a <hi>Debtor</hi> has Priviledge only for the <hi>King's</hi> benefit, which is now disused. But <hi>Conusance</hi> is not to be allowed in any case, if it appear that by allowing it there would be a <hi>failer of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:</hi> As when they cannot try the cause, because it is local. But if this do not appear at first, the cause shall be adjorn'd thither, and upon any Erroneous or Irregular Procéedings a <hi>Resummons</hi> lieth. <hi>Et Adjornatur.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sawyer, Conusance</hi> ought not to be allowed in this cause. <hi>First,</hi> Because it appears by the Demand, that Conusance is granted to the <hi>Chancellor</hi> or his <hi>Comissary</hi> or <hi>Deputy;</hi> but the Demand here is made by the <hi>Deputy and Bayliff of the Vice-Chancellour;</hi> and so by the Deputy of a Deputy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Grant made to the Vniversity. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Defendant is not alledged to have béen a Priviledged person, when the cause of Action accrued, but only when the Action was commenced: And perchance he was not Priviledged when the cause of Action accrued; and if so, he ought not to have it allowed. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Grant extends not to this Court, because not named, but only to the Courts of King's Bench, Common Pleas and other inferior Courts. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is not consistent with the Dignity of this Court, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the words <hi>and other Courts, &amp;c.</hi> after the naming of several inferior Courts. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If they have <hi>Conusance</hi> of the cause, yet they cannot determin this cause, because it is laid in <hi>London:</hi> And they cannot try by Iury a cause laid there, because it is out of their Iurisdiction; and an inferior Court must upon <hi>Conusance</hi> allowed, proceed upon the same Plea and Declaration, as appears <hi>Co.

                  <hi>Resp.</hi> This is not material, for a <hi>Bayliff</hi> may properly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.</p>
               <p>A <hi>fourth Object.</hi> has béen made, because the Defendant does not appear to have béen a Priviledged person, at the time that the Action acerued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> He shall be intended to have béen so, if the contrary appear not; and the <hi>Presidents</hi> are with us as to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> It seems clearly to me that the <hi>Demand</hi> here is good, and that the <hi>University</hi> ought to have the <hi>Conusance</hi> allowed: <hi>First,</hi> Because the Patent is <hi>General.</hi> that they shall have <hi>Conusance</hi> of all Causes <hi>ubicunque, &amp;c. in Anglia,</hi> and power to procéed as they will, according to the <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Civil Law.</hi> But such a Patent would be void at Common-Law: Because not limited to a certain place, and because it impowers them to procéed according to the Civil-Law: But this Patent is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Act of Parliament, 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and that as fully, as if it had béen transcribed into the Act <hi>verbatim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are three things considerable. <hi>First,</hi> Whether or no the Suit here by <hi>Quo minus,</hi> be a hindrance to the Priviledge of the <hi>University?</hi> And I hold it is not, for the Priviledge of a Debtor only Entitles himself to the Court, but is no bar to any other Priviledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the Grant extend to this Court or not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> It does most clearly, because the Grant begins with Superior Courts, as King's Bench, Common-Pleas, and then descends to other Inferior Courts, &amp;c. these words are sufficient to comprehend this Court, which is not Superior to the King's Bench or Common-Pleas. And by the Cases cited in 21 and 24 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it appears that this Grant extends to Causes depending in the Chancery and Exchequer, <hi>Ergo', &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether or no if the Plaintiff be dismist here, there will be a failer of Iustice?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> There will not, there was in 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> a case betwixt <hi>Spelling</hi> and <hi>Jeffard:</hi> Where the Town of <hi>Maidstone</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Conusance, and it was held that the laying of the Action in <hi>London</hi> did not ouste the Conusance; because the Suit here was to stay and be dismist, and the Plaintiff to proceed there <hi>ab Origine de novo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better apprehension of this, it is to be known that there are thrée sorts of Conusance of Pleas. <hi>First,</hi> There is <hi>Tenere placita,</hi> which does not oust any other Court of Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; but creates a concurrent Iurisdiction. The <hi>Second,</hi> is <hi>cognitio placitorum;</hi> as when a Plea is commenced here of
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:52142:228"/> which the <hi>Conusance</hi> belongs to another Court. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is a <hi>Conusance</hi> of Pleas with an <hi>Exclusive</hi> Iurisdiction, as in this case, that no other Court shall hold Plea, &amp;c. and this is a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to any other Court. The first is a Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Iurisdiction; the Second is to be taken advantage of by Plea, and after Tryal the Cause to be Remanded: The Third is Exclusive of all others, and is a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to them, <hi>Vide</hi> 20 <hi>Jac. B.R. in Halsley's Case, and</hi> 1 <hi>Car. B.R.</hi> where it is held, that the laying of the Action in another place is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, because they must begin <hi>de novo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is the Objection material, that the Vice-Chancellor, and not the Chancellor demands <hi>Conusance,</hi> for the Court here is to supersede upon notice of the Patent. He concluded for the <hi>University,</hi> that the <hi>Conusance</hi> ought to be allowed. <hi>Baron Turner</hi> Accordingly; and <hi>Conusance</hi> was allowed accordingly.</p>

               <p>UPon a Plea to a Bill in Equity, the case appeared to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(2)"/> thus; <hi>viz.</hi> A man upon marriage Covenanted to pay his Wife 1000 <hi>l.</hi> within two years after his death, and for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof entred into a Statute; but before this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Statute he had mortgaged part of his Land for 500 <hi>l.</hi> for certain years: Afterwards he devised these Lands to his Wife, and her Heirs, if the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> were not paid to her according to the Marriage-Covenant, she paying off the said 500 <hi>l.</hi> He died, and made his Wife Executrix, to whose hands Assets came; the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> was not paid to the Wife, she paid off the 500 <hi>l.</hi> and had the mortgaged Lands assigned to her; She then Convey'd over the mortgaged Land in Fee by Fine, and died; and now the Question was, Whether or no the Heir of the <hi>Covenantor</hi> could redeem, paying the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and the 500 <hi>l.</hi> with Interest upon discount of Profits?</p>
               <pb n="512" facs="tcp:52142:229"/>
               <p>The <hi>Chief Baron</hi> was of Opinion, that the Devise to the Feme was absolute, if the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> were not paid, which deprives the Heir of the Covenantor of any Right of Redemption: But if that were otherwise, yet he thought the Fine with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, according to the <hi>Statute of</hi> 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. would bar an Equitable power of Redemption, as well as a Right of Action. So a <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Non-claim</hi> will bar a Trust, if levied by a Stranger, and not by the Trustée himself; for then the Trust will go along with the Land: But a Fine levied by a Mortgagée will not bar an Equity of Redemption; and so it has been often Adjudged. He said also, that it had been often Adjudged, That if an Executor had Assets, he is compellable to redeem Mortgages for the benefit of the Heir: So if an Heir be charged in Debt, where the Executor has Assets, the Heir may compel the Executor in Equity to pay the Debt; but a Creditor may Sue either of them, and shall have the benefit of his Security. <hi>Et Adjornatur.</hi>
